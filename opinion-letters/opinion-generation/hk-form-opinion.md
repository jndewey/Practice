Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel for [insert name of client], a [insert state and

contemplated by the [insert name of principal agreement] dated as of [__________]
(the "Agreement" [or define more specifically, such as "Credit Agreement"]), among
the Company and [insert other parties] (the Company and [insert other client parties]
are referred to herein collectively as the "Relevant Parties"). This opinion letter
is furnished to you [solely for purposes of complying with the requirements of
Section __ of the Agreement] [at the request of our client]. Capitalized terms that
are defined in the Agreement and are used but not defined herein have the meanings
given them in the Agreement.

In connection with this opinion letter, we have examined original counterparts or
copies of original counterparts of the [following] documents[: [list documents]
[listed in Schedule I.A hereto] (the "Transaction Documents"). We have also examined
originals or copies of the organizational documents and such other records of the
Relevant Parties, certificates and web sites of public officials and of officers or
other representatives of the Relevant Parties and agreements and other documents, and
made such other investigations, as we have deemed necessary, subject to the
assumptions set forth below, as a basis for the opinions expressed below.

### ASSUMPTIONS

action was taken, and had the power and authority to take such action, all necessary
action has been taken to authorize such action, and such action has been validly
effected.

(vii) That there has not been any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding, fraud,
duress, or undue influence in connection with the negotiation, execution, or delivery
of the Transaction Documents.

(viii) That the Transaction Documents will be enforced in circumstances and in a
manner in which it is commercially reasonable to do so and the conduct of the parties
complies with any requirement of good faith and fair dealing.

(ix) That there are no agreements or understandings among the parties, written or
oral, and there is no usage of trade or course of prior dealing among the parties
that would, in any case, define the terms of, supplement, amend, modify, terminate,
release, or satisfy the Transaction Documents.

(x) That none of the Relevant Parties is a party to any pending action or proceeding
before any court, governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, or
official, board of arbitration, or arbitrator that may adversely affect the matters

Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not:

such Relevant Party [(other than any Applicable Contract, to the extent we opine

is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by any Relevant Party of
any Transaction Document to which it is a party or, if any such authorization,
approval, action, notice or filing is required, it has been duly obtained, taken,
given or made and is in full force and effect.

(xiii) With respect to each Relevant Party that is a limited liability company or

Transaction Documents to which it is a party and has duly executed and delivered such

necessary action and do not contravene its organizational documents.]

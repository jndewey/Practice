## 1. UCC Foreclosure Overview

Because the mezzanine collateral consists of personal property interests (LLC membership interests), foreclosure is governed by UCC Article 9 — not by state mortgage foreclosure law. This is the single most important practical advantage of the mezzanine structure: UCC foreclosure can be completed in 30-90 days, compared to years for mortgage foreclosure in some jurisdictions.

### Prerequisites for Foreclosure

1. **Default**: An event of default must occur under the mezzanine loan (cross-reference to the loan agreement's default provisions)
2. **Reasonableness**: The foreclosure must be commercially reasonable in method, manner, time, and place
3. **Notice**: The mezzanine borrower must receive timely notice of the foreclosure (typically 10 days for commercial transactions, but check the governing state's UCC)

## 2. Foreclosure Methods

### Private Disposition (Private Sale)

The mezzanine lender sells the pledged collateral in a commercially reasonable private sale. Requirements:
- Commercially reasonable notice to the pledgor
- Sale must be on commercially reasonable terms
- No requirement for public advertising or competitive bidding
- The lender may purchase at a private sale if the collateral has a recognized market or is customarily sold on a recognized market

### Public Disposition (Public Sale / Auction)

The mezzanine lender sells the collateral at public auction. Requirements:
- Public notice (typically published and sent to debtor)
- Sale at a commercially reasonable time and place
- The lender may credit bid at a public sale (bid up to the amount of the outstanding mezzanine debt)

### Strict Foreclosure (Acceptance of Collateral)

The mezzanine lender proposes to accept the collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the secured obligations. Requirements:
- Written proposal sent to pledgor and other secured parties
- If full satisfaction: No objection received within 20 days
- If partial satisfaction: Pledgor must consent in writing
- Any secured party may object within 20 days, forcing a disposition sale

**Strict foreclosure is often the preferred method** for mezzanine lenders pursuing a loan-to-own strategy because it avoids the costs and uncertainties of a sale process.

### Commercially Reasonable Standard

All aspects of the foreclosure process must be commercially reasonable. Factors courts consider:
- The method of sale (public vs. private)
- The terms of the sale
- Advertising and marketing efforts
- The price obtained (though low price alone is generally insufficient to show unreasonableness)
- Whether the lender acted in good faith
- Industry custom and practice

## 3. Continuation of Mortgage Lien Post-Foreclosure

**Critical principle**: Mezzanine loan foreclosure does NOT affect the mortgage loan or the mortgage lender's lien on the property. After mezzanine foreclosure:

- The mortgage borrower remains liable under the mortgage loan
- The property continues to secure the mortgage loan
- The mortgage loan terms are unchanged
- The new owner of the mezzanine collateral (whether the mezzanine lender or a third-party purchaser) steps into the shoes of the former mezzanine borrower

If the new owner cannot prevent a subsequent mortgage default, the mezzanine lender can be wiped out by the mortgage foreclosure — the property value passes to the mortgage lender, leaving the mezzanine collateral (ownership of a now-assetless mortgage borrower) worthless.

## 4. Exercising Control of Pledged Entity

### Pre-Foreclosure Control

Most pledge agreements grant the mezzanine lender the ability to vote the pledged interests after default, even before formal foreclosure. Typical pre-foreclosure actions include:
- Replacing the manager of the mortgage borrower
- Blocking unauthorized transactions
- Directing cash distributions
- Preventing voluntary bankruptcy filings

The pledge agreement typically includes an irrevocable proxy giving the lender exclusive authority over Article 8 Matters at all times, and broader voting rights after default.

### Post-Foreclosure Control

After foreclosure, the mezzanine lender (or purchaser at the UCC sale) becomes the sole member of the mortgage borrower and exercises full ownership rights, subject to:
- The existing mortgage loan obligations
- Intercreditor agreement requirements (new guarantor, property management approval, financial tests)
- Any personal contracts of the mortgage borrower

## 5. Lender Liability Risks

### General Lender Liability

Under the theory of lender liability, a lender can be held liable for actions involving collateral if found to be "in control" of the collateral by its actions. Liability can accrue even though the lender does not hold legal title. If a lender exercises control over an entity for a specific purpose, it may be liable for the entity's actions — whether or not the lender specifically directed the offending action.

### CERCLA Environmental Liability

The most serious consequence arises under CERCLA (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980). If a court finds the mezzanine lender had sufficient control over the mortgage borrower's operations at the property to qualify as an "environmentally responsible party," the lender faces strict, joint and several environmental liability.

### Risk Mitigation

- **Pre-default**: Exercise only the specifically enumerated proxy rights (primarily Article 8 Matters). Do not participate in day-to-day property management or operations.
- **Post-default but pre-foreclosure**: Exercise control rights cautiously. Focus on protective actions (blocking harmful transactions) rather than affirmative management.
- **Post-foreclosure**: The lender is now an owner, not a lender, and standard owner liability applies. Ensure environmental insurance coverage.

## 6. Loan-to-Own Strategy

### Mechanics

A mezzanine lender employing this strategy anticipates borrower default and plans to:
1. Foreclose the mezzanine pledge (via UCC foreclosure)
2. Gain direct ownership and control of the mortgage borrower
3. Gain indirect ownership and control of the mortgaged property
4. Acquire the property at below-market cost

### Total Acquisition Cost

The effective purchase price equals:
- Outstanding mortgage debt (which continues post-foreclosure)
- Unpaid mezzanine debt
- Mezzanine loan origination costs
- Foreclosure costs

### Optimal Conditions

The strategy is most effective when:
- The property is fundamentally sound but experiencing temporary difficulties
- The property is in a market expected to improve (short-term modestly or long-term significantly)
- The property needs essential repairs the sponsor cannot afford
- The sponsor has personal financial difficulties unrelated to the property market

### Borrower Protections

Borrowers should negotiate:
- Mandatory workout/modification discussions before foreclosure
- Extended notice and cure periods
- Restrictions on the lender's ability to accelerate for minor defaults
- Guarantor release provisions tied to foreclosure

## 7. Comparison: Mezzanine vs. Mortgage Foreclosure

| Feature | Mezzanine (UCC) | Mortgage (Real Property) |
|---|---|---|
| **Governing law** | UCC Article 9 | State mortgage/foreclosure law |
| **Timeline** | 30-90 days | Months to years (2+ years in some states post-2008) |
| **Cost** | Relatively low | Substantial (court costs, legal fees, receivership) |
| **Methods** | Private sale, public sale, strict foreclosure | Judicial foreclosure, power of sale (non-judicial), deed in lieu |
| **Notice requirement** | 10 days (commercial, varies by state) | Varies widely by state (30-120+ days) |
| **Redemption rights** | Generally none under UCC | Statutory redemption period in many states |
| **Effect on senior lien** | None — mortgage continues | N/A (mortgage is the senior lien) |
| **Deficiency judgment** | Available (subject to commercial reasonableness) | Available in many states (subject to anti-deficiency statutes) |
| **Credit bid** | Yes (at public sale) | Yes |
| **Court involvement** | Not required (unless challenged) | Required in judicial foreclosure states |

### Non-Judicial Alternatives to Mortgage Foreclosure

When mortgage foreclosure is impractical, mortgage lenders may pursue:
- **Loan workout**: Modified loan terms
- **Deed in lieu of foreclosure**: Borrower conveys property to lender
- **Receivership**: Court-appointed receiver manages the property

These alternatives are generally not available to mezzanine lenders in the same form, but the UCC remedies (particularly strict foreclosure) serve a similar expedited function.

### Avoiding Mortgage Foreclosure Wipeout

Mezzanine lenders must avoid allowing the mortgage loan to reach foreclosure (which would wipe out the mezzanine collateral). Defensive options:
1. **Foreclose the mezzanine loan** → become new owner of mortgage borrower → negotiate workout with mortgage lender
2. **Purchase the mortgage loan** under intercreditor agreement rights
3. **Cure mortgage loan defaults** under intercreditor agreement cure rights

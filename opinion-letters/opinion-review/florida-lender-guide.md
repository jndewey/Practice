# Florida-Specific Guidance for Lender's Counsel Reviewing Opinions

This reference covers Florida-specific issues that lender's counsel should
watch for when reviewing third-party legal opinion letters in Florida
commercial real estate finance transactions. It draws from the Florida Bar's
"Report on Third-Party Legal Opinion Customary Practice in Florida" (the
"Florida Report"), Florida statutes, and Holland & Knight practice guidance.

## I. Entity Existence and Status

### A. Certificates of Status (Not "Good Standing")

Florida does not issue "certificates of good standing." Instead, the Florida
Department of State, Division of Corporations issues **certificates of status**
that show an entity as **"active"** (not "in good standing").

**What to verify in the opinion:**
- The opinion should state that the entity "is currently existing under the
  laws of [state of organization] and the [entity type] status is active"
  (for Florida entities) or use equivalent language
- Do not expect "good standing" language for Florida entities
- For non-Florida entities qualified in Florida, the opinion should state
  they are "authorized to transact business in the State of Florida, and
  such status is active"

### B. Florida Entity Statutes

Ensure the opinion references the correct current statutes:

| Entity Type | Statute | Key Note |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Corporations | Ch. 607, Fla. Stat. | 2019 amendments substantially revised the FBCA |
| LLCs | Ch. 605, Fla. Stat. | Florida Revised LLC Act, effective Jan. 1, 2014 |
| Limited Partnerships | Ch. 620, Fla. Stat. | Florida Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act |
| Land Trusts | §689.071, Fla. Stat. | 2013 revisions significantly updated |

🟡 **NEGOTIATE** if the opinion cites outdated statutes (e.g., old Ch. 608
for LLCs, which was replaced by Ch. 605 effective 2014).

### C. Dissolution / Winding Up Assumptions

For Florida LLCs and LPs, the opinion giver may include an assumption that
the entity has not taken steps to dissolve or wind up. This is acceptable
because dissolution can occur by member/partner vote without a public filing.

## II. Enforceability — Florida Considerations

### A. Standard Formulation

Florida customary practice follows the same enforceability formulation as
national practice: legal, valid, binding obligation enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to the bankruptcy exception and equitable principles.

### B. Remedies Qualification — Florida "Golden Nugget"

The Florida Report endorses the "golden nugget" approach to the remedies
qualification. The opinion giver states that despite potential
unenforceability of specific provisions, the Transaction Documents contain
adequate provisions for the practical realization of the principal rights
and benefits, including:

- **Repayment** of principal and interest
- **Acceleration** upon default
- **Foreclosure** on real property collateral
- **Realization** on personal property collateral

**Lender's counsel should verify** that the remedies qualification
expressly preserves these four core rights. If any is omitted, flag
as 🟡 NEGOTIATE.

### C. Specific Enforceability Exceptions — Florida-Specific

In addition to the standard national exceptions, Florida opinions commonly
qualify enforceability with respect to:

- **Confession of judgment**: Void in Florida under Fla. Stat. §55.05
- **Attorney's fees**: Florida follows the prevailing party reciprocity
  doctrine — a contractual attorney's fees provision that benefits only
  one party may be applied reciprocally (§57.105)
- **Late charges**: Must be a reasonable estimate of damages, not a penalty
- **Default interest**: Enforceability may be limited if characterized as
  a penalty rather than compensation for increased risk
- **Power of sale**: Florida is a judicial foreclosure state — contractual
  power of sale clauses are generally not enforceable for real property

---

## III. Usury — Florida Requirements

### A. Applicable Rates

Florida usury law provides different maximum rates depending on loan size:

| Loan Amount | Maximum Rate | Statute | Classification |
|-------------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| ≤ $500,000 | 18% simple interest | §687.02, Fla. Stat. | Misdemeanor |
| > $500,000 | 25% simple interest | §687.071, Fla. Stat. | Criminal usury |

### B. Calculation Method

- **Simple interest** (not compound)
- **365-day year**, actual number of days elapsed
- Interest includes all charges that constitute "interest" under Florida
  law (broader than the contract rate — includes points, fees, and other
  charges that are in substance interest)

### C. What the Usury Opinion Should Say

The usury opinion should provide that the transaction documents "will not
violate the usury laws of the State of Florida, provided that the [Lender]
has not and does not reserve, charge, take, or receive... interest...
exceeding the equivalent of the rate of [18%/25%] simple interest per year,
calculated on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days
elapsed."

**Lender's counsel should verify:**
- [ ] Correct rate is used (18% or 25% based on loan amount)
- [ ] Calculation method specified (simple interest, 365-day year, actual
  days)
- [ ] The opinion is conditioned on the lender not exceeding the rate
  (this places the obligation on the lender, not the opinion giver)
- [ ] If the loan has tiered rates or variable rates, the opinion should
  address the maximum possible rate

### D. Choice of Validating Law

If the transaction documents specify a governing law other than Florida
for usury purposes (e.g., New York, which has a 16% civil usury limit
but broad exemptions for loans over $250,000), the opinion may include
a choice-of-law opinion for usury.

Per Continental Mortgage Investors v. Sailboat Key, Inc. (395 So.2d 507,
Fla. 1981) and Morgan Walton Properties, Inc. v. Int'l City Bank & Trust
Co. (404 So.2d 1059, Fla. 1981):

- Florida courts apply the "normal and reasonable relationship" test
- Factors supporting enforcement of choice: lender organized/domiciled
  in chosen jurisdiction, lender has offices there, documents executed
  and delivered there, loan funded from and repaid to accounts there
- Opinion should use "more likely than not" language (not "will")

---

## IV. Choice of Law — Florida Standards

### A. When Required

A choice-of-law opinion is needed when the transaction documents are
governed by a law other than Florida law and the borrower or property
is in Florida.

### B. Expected Formulation

The Florida choice-of-law opinion should state that the choice of [chosen
state] law "would more likely than not be recognized and enforced by a
state or federal court sitting in and applying the choice of law principles
of the State of Florida," subject to standard exceptions.

**Note the "more likely than not" standard** — this is weaker than
"would be enforced" or "is valid." It reflects the uncertainty inherent
in choice-of-law analysis and is customary in Florida.

### C. Standard Exceptions to Choice of Law

The choice-of-law opinion is typically subject to these exceptions:

1. **Usury**: Florida courts may apply Florida usury law regardless of
   contractual choice if the transaction has a normal and reasonable
   relationship to Florida
2. **Public policy**: The chosen law will not be applied if it would
   violate a fundamental Florida public policy
3. **Real property liens**: Validity and priority of liens on Florida
   real property are governed by Florida law regardless of contractual
   choice
4. **Personal property perfection**: Perfection of security interests
   in personal property is governed by the UCC of the applicable
   jurisdiction (typically debtor's location), not contractual choice
5. **UCC §1-105(2) / §1-301**: UCC provisions that cannot be varied by
   agreement
6. **Procedural vs. substantive**: A Florida court will apply its own
   procedural rules regardless of the governing law chosen

### D. Supporting Factors

For the choice-of-law opinion to be supportable, lender's counsel should
confirm that the lender has a genuine connection to the chosen jurisdiction.
The more factors present, the stronger the opinion:

- [ ] Lender is organized in the chosen jurisdiction
- [ ] Lender is domiciled in the chosen jurisdiction
- [ ] Lender has offices in the chosen jurisdiction
- [ ] Documents were executed and delivered in the chosen jurisdiction
- [ ] Loan will be funded from an account in the chosen jurisdiction
- [ ] Loan will be repaid to an account in the chosen jurisdiction

## V. Tax Opinions — Documentary Stamp Tax and Intangible Tax

### A. Documentary Stamp Tax

- **Statute**: Ch. 201, Fla. Stat.
- **Rate**: $0.35 per $100 on promissory notes and mortgages
- **Due**: At time of recording (mortgages) or execution (notes)
- **Consequence of non-payment**: Document is unenforceable until tax
  (plus interest and penalties) is paid; but non-payment does NOT affect
  lien validity or constructive notice from recording

### B. Nonrecurring Intangible Tax

- **Statute**: §199.133, Fla. Stat.
- **Rate**: 2 mills ($0.002) per dollar of obligation secured by Florida
  real property
- **Due**: Within 30 days of recording the mortgage in Florida
- **Consequence of non-payment**: Same as documentary stamp tax —
  unenforceable until paid, but lien validity and constructive notice
  are not affected

### C. Three Tax Opinion Variants

The tax opinion will take one of three forms depending on where the
documents were executed:

1. **No tax due**: If documents were executed and delivered entirely
   outside Florida and the note is not secured by Florida real property,
   no documentary stamp tax is due. (Rare in FL real estate deals.)

2. **Correct amount stated**: The correct amount of documentary stamp
   tax and/or intangible tax is stated in the Notice to Recorder or has
   been paid. This is the typical formulation.

3. **Consequences of non-payment**: If the opinion giver cannot confirm
   payment, the opinion describes the legal consequences — the document
   is unenforceable until paid, but the lien remains valid and recording
   provides constructive notice.

**Lender's counsel should verify:**
- [ ] The appropriate variant is used based on the facts
- [ ] The tax rate applied is current and correct
- [ ] For construction loans with future advance provisions, the
  intangible tax calculation accounts for the full commitment amount
- [ ] The opinion addresses both documentary stamp tax AND intangible
  tax (they are separate taxes with separate payment obligations)

## VI. Foreign Qualification Opinion — Florida

### A. When Required

If the borrower (or any loan party) is organized outside Florida but
does business in Florida, a foreign qualification opinion confirms the
entity is authorized to transact business in Florida.

### B. Expected Language

"[Entity] is authorized to transact business in the State of Florida,
and such status is active."

Based on a certificate of status from the Florida Division of Corporations.

### C. Consequences of Failure to Qualify

Under Florida law:
- An entity transacting business in Florida without qualification cannot
  maintain any proceeding in Florida courts until it qualifies
  (§607.1501 for corporations, §605.0902 for LLCs)
- The failure does not impair the validity of contracts or prevent the
  entity from defending proceedings
- But it may affect the entity's ability to affirmatively enforce its
  rights in Florida courts

---

## VII. Lender Qualification — Florida

### A. Generally Not Required

The Florida Report and H&K practice guidance strongly discourage lender
qualification opinions. They are not customary and raise complex issues.

### B. If Requested

If the lender insists (e.g., for non-bank lenders), the opinion giver
should note several exceptions and qualifications:

- **Non-financial-institution lenders** may need a registered office in
  Florida (§607.0505 for corporations)
- **Taking title to collateral** through foreclosure may trigger
  qualification requirements
- **Mortgage lender licensing**: Non-bank lenders making residential
  mortgage loans may need licensure under Ch. 494, Fla. Stat. (this
  typically does not apply to commercial loans)
- **Finance company licensing**: Depending on the lender's activities,
  Ch. 516 (consumer finance) or other regulatory schemes may apply

**Lender's counsel should generally not request this opinion** unless
there is a specific reason to believe the lender's activities in Florida
require qualification or licensure.

## VIII. Local Counsel vs. Primary Counsel — Florida

### A. When Local Counsel Opinions Are Needed

Local counsel opinions are appropriate when:
- Primary counsel is not admitted in Florida
- The transaction involves Florida real property (for lien validity,
  title, and recording opinions)
- Florida-specific opinions are needed (usury, choice of law, taxes,
  entity status under Florida statutes)

### B. Scope of Local Counsel Opinion

The local counsel opinion is limited to Florida law matters. Local
counsel should:

- Assume matters covered by primary counsel (e.g., if primary counsel
  gives the enforceability opinion under NY law, local counsel need not
  re-opine)
- Give Florida-specific opinions only (entity existence under FL law,
  FL foreign qualification, FL usury, FL choice of law, FL taxes, FL
  real property lien validity)
- Use the same assumptions and qualifications framework as primary
  counsel, adapted for local scope

### C. Coordination

Lender's counsel should ensure that between primary counsel and local
counsel:
- [ ] All required opinions are covered (no gaps)
- [ ] No opinion is given by both (unless intended for reinforcement)
- [ ] Assumptions of one counsel align with opinions of the other
- [ ] The opinions, taken together, satisfy the conditions precedent

## IX. Construction Loan — Additional Florida Considerations

### A. Mechanics' Lien Issues

Florida's Construction Lien Law (Ch. 713, Fla. Stat.) creates liens
that can prime the mortgage if the lien claimant's work commenced before
the mortgage was recorded. The opinion typically does not address
mechanics' lien priority (this is a title insurance matter), but lender's
counsel should be aware of:

- Notice to Owner requirements
- Lien waiver procedures at each draw
- The construction lender's exposure to priming liens

### B. Future Advance Mortgages

Florida law recognizes future advance mortgages (§697.04, Fla. Stat.).
The opinion may address whether advances under the mortgage will have
the same priority as the original mortgage. This depends on whether
the advances are obligatory or optional.

### C. Completion Guaranty

If a completion guaranty is part of the transaction, ensure:
- [ ] The enforceability opinion covers the guaranty
- [ ] The remedies qualification preserves the guaranty's core benefits
- [ ] Fraudulent conveyance savings (if included) are appropriately
  tailored for the guarantor's obligations

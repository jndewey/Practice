## Florida General Assumption — Documentary Stamp and Other Taxes

Include in the assumptions section:

"That any Florida documentary stamp taxes and nonrecurring intangible taxes required
to be paid in connection with the execution, delivery, recording, or filing of the
Transaction Documents or related documents have been paid when due."

---

## Florida Entity Existence Opinion

Replace the standard Opinion 1 with:

"Each Relevant Party is a [corporation] [limited liability company] [limited
partnership] that is currently existing under the laws of [its state of
organization] [the State of Florida] and the [corporate] [limited liability company]
[limited partnership] status of each Relevant Party in such state is active."

**Note:** Florida does not use "good standing" — use "active" status language.

---

## Florida Foreign Qualification Opinion

Replace the standard Opinion 3 with:

"Based solely on certificates of public officials described in Schedule I.C hereto
(which, with your permission, we assume remain accurate as of the date hereof),
each Relevant Party is authorized to transact business in the State of Florida,
and such status is active."

---

## Florida Usury Opinion

"The [Note] and the interest provided for therein will not violate the usury laws
of the State of Florida, provided that the [Lender] has not and does not reserve,
charge, take, or receive, directly or indirectly, at any time, interest or other
sums deemed to be in the nature of interest in an amount exceeding the equivalent
of the rate of [18%/25%] simple interest per year, calculated on the basis of a
365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed."

**Rate Selection:**
- 18% for loans of $500,000 or less (§687.02, Fla. Stat.)
- 25% for loans exceeding $500,000 (§687.071, Fla. Stat.)

## Florida Choice of Law Opinion

### Standard Formulation

"The choice of law provisions contained in the Transaction Documents specifying
[governing law jurisdiction] law as the law in accordance with which the validity,
interpretation, and enforcement of the Transaction Documents and the rights and
obligations of the parties thereto shall be governed (excluding those laws as they
relate to the resolution of conflicts between laws of different jurisdictions
[and except as may be otherwise specified in such Transaction Documents]) would
more likely than not be recognized and enforced by a state or federal court sitting
in and applying the choice of law principles of the State of Florida [assuming that
the transaction bears a reasonable relationship to the State of (governing law
jurisdiction)], except that the court may apply the laws of Florida or another
jurisdiction if and to the extent that:

(a) the issue involves interest rate limitations or usury,
(b) the court deems the application of the laws of [governing law jurisdiction]
    to a particular provision to be against the fundamental or public policy of
    Florida, such other jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction whose laws would
    otherwise govern,
(c) the issue involves the creation, enforceability, and constructive notice of
    liens against interests in real property located outside of the State of
    [governing law jurisdiction], and remedies in connection therewith,
(d) the issue involves the perfection and effect of perfection or nonperfection
    of security interests in personal property, the priority of security interests,
    and remedies in connection therewith,
(e) Section 1-105(2) of the UCC otherwise provides, or
(f) a provision in the Transaction Documents is deemed to be procedural rather
    than substantive."

### Choice of Law Assumption

"For purposes of the opinion expressed in opinion paragraph ___ below relating to
[governing law jurisdiction] choice of law, that the transactions were negotiated
in [governing law jurisdiction], offices of the [_________] are located in
[governing law jurisdiction], primary counsel for the [________] is located in
[governing law jurisdiction], representatives of the Relevant Parties traveled to
[governing law jurisdiction] for such negotiations, records and accounts of the
[___________] with respect to the loans will be maintained in [governing law
jurisdiction], and the loans will be funded from and repaid to [governing law
jurisdiction]."

### Choice of Law — Usury-Specific

"Specifically with respect to matters of usury, in Continental Mortgage Investors
v. Sailboat Key, Inc., 395 So.2d 507 (Fla. 1981), the Florida Supreme Court held
that a Florida court will recognize choice of law provisions in mortgage loan
documents that select a validating usury law of a jurisdiction other than the State
of Florida, provided that the loan transaction has a 'normal relationship' to the
chosen jurisdiction. Although the borrower and the mortgaged property in the
Sailboat Key transaction were located in the State of Florida, the Court recited
that under the circumstances, a 'normal relationship' with the chosen jurisdiction
existed where (a) the lender was organized under the laws of the chosen jurisdiction
and had its domicile and only office in the chosen jurisdiction, (b) the loan
documents were executed and delivered in the chosen jurisdiction, and (c) the loan
was funded from and repaid in the chosen jurisdiction. In Morgan Walton Properties,
Inc. v. International City Bank & Trust Co., 404 So.2d 1059 (Fla. 1981), the Court
described the test as one of a 'normal and reasonable relationship,' and again
recognized choice of law provisions selecting a validating usury law of a
jurisdiction other than Florida. Because the [Administrative Agent/Lender] may not
be organized, domiciled, and have its only office in the State of [governing law
jurisdiction], we cannot say with certainty that a sufficiently 'normal relationship'
exists between the State of [governing law jurisdiction] and this transaction for a
Florida court to uphold the application of [governing law jurisdiction] law to the
Transaction Documents with respect to usury."

## Florida Transaction Tax Opinions

### Option 1: No Tax Due (Out-of-State Execution and Delivery)

"No Florida documentary stamp tax is payable to the State of Florida or to any
jurisdiction therein by virtue of the execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents, the creation of the indebtedness evidenced by any of the Transaction
Documents, or the filing or recording of the Financing Statement."

OR (broader version):

"No taxes or other charges, including, without limitation, documentary stamp tax or
nonrecurring intangible tax, mortgage or recording taxes, transfer taxes, or similar
charges, are payable to the State of Florida or to any jurisdiction therein by virtue
of the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents, the creation of the
indebtedness evidenced or secured by any of the Transaction Documents, or the filing
or recording of the Financing Statement, except for nominal filing or recording fees.
We express no opinion herein as to any possible corporate income taxes, sales taxes,
or franchise fees or taxes imposed by the State of Florida that may be applicable to
the [Agent/Lender]."

### Assumption for Out-of-State Delivery Tax Opinion

"For the purposes of the opinions expressed in opinion paragraphs ____ below:
[(i) all Florida documentary stamp taxes and nonrecurring intangible taxes required
to be paid in connection with the execution, delivery, recording, or filing of the
Existing Documents or related documents have been paid when due;]
[(ii)] the [Credit Agreement] (including each of its signature pages), any notes,
and any other documents containing promises to pay sums certain, are not and will
not be made, executed, delivered, sold, transferred, or assigned in the State of
Florida,
[(iii)] no mortgage, trust deed, security agreement, or other security instrument
(other than UCC financing statements) is or will be filed or recorded in the State
of Florida, and
[(iv)] other than the Credit Agreement and any notes, none of the loan documents
executed in connection with the financing incorporate the Credit Agreement, any
notes, or any document with a promise to pay a sum certain, by reference."

### Option 2: All Tax on Mortgage Has Been Paid

"The 'Notice to Recorder' clause on the first page of the [Mortgage] reflects the
correct amounts of Florida documentary stamp tax and Florida nonrecurring intangible
tax that are due (i) in the case of the documentary stamp tax, upon the recording
of the [Mortgage] and (ii) in the case of the nonrecurring intangible tax, upon the
execution of the [Mortgage] assuming that the [Mortgage] is recorded in Florida
within 30 days after its execution, under Florida Statutes, Chapters 201 and 199,
respectively. [Failure to pay any applicable documentary stamp tax or any applicable
intangible tax with respect to any document upon which such tax is required may
delay the enforceability of the document in a Florida court until such time as the
proper amount of tax (and any relevant interest, late fees, and penalties) is paid
and the clerk of circuit court collecting the tax has noted its payment on the
instrument or given other receipt for it, but will not affect the constructive notice
given by the recording of the [Mortgage].]"

## Florida Foreign Judgment Enforcement Opinion

"The laws of the State of Florida provide that, subject to the following exceptions,
a judgment in personam rendered in a court of the [_____________] (the 'foreign
court') that is final and conclusive and enforceable where rendered, is conclusive
between the parties to the extent that it grants or denies recovery of a sum of
money other than for taxes, a fine or other penalty, or for support in matrimonial
or family matters, and may be recognized and enforced in compliance with statutory
procedures..."

**Grounds for non-recognition** (Florida's UFCMJRA):
- System lacks impartial tribunals/due process
- Foreign court lacked personal jurisdiction
- Foreign court lacked subject matter jurisdiction
- Insufficient notice to defendant
- Obtained by fraud or contrary to natural justice
- Repugnant to Florida public policy
- Conflicts with another final order
- Contrary to agreement for alternative dispute resolution
- Seriously inconvenient forum (for jurisdiction based only on personal service)
- Foreign jurisdiction would not recognize similar Florida judgment
- Defamation judgment without adequate free speech protections
- Stay of judgment pending appeal
- Enforcement constitutes enforcement of foreign revenue/penal laws
- New relevant evidence discovered
- Recognition proceeding not timely commenced

## Florida Lender Qualification Opinion

**H&K strongly discourages this opinion.** If required:

"Neither the making of the [Loan], nor the ownership of the [Notes], the [Mortgage],
or the other Transaction Documents, nor the enforcement thereof in the State of
Florida, will, in each case solely as the result of such actions, (a) constitute
'doing business' in the State of Florida or otherwise require qualification [or
registration] of the Lender in the State of Florida..."

**Exceptions noted:**
(i) Non-"financial institution" lenders may need registered office/agent under
§607.0505, Fla. Stat.
(ii) Taking title to or operating Florida collateral may trigger qualification
(iii) Mortgage lender licensing under Ch. 494, Fla. Stat. (unless exempt)
(iv) No opinion on other FL activities or physical presence

**Consequences of failure to qualify:**
- §607.1501: Cannot bring suit until qualified; fees and civil penalty ($500-$1,000/yr)
- §607.0505: No bar on suit; $500/yr penalty; forgiven upon compliance
- Neither affects creation or perfection of liens

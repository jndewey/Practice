- Dimensional and bulk requirements (lot size, height, FAR, setbacks, lot coverage)
- Parking requirements (calculation methods, deficiency analysis)
- Certificates of occupancy (validity, currency, amendments)

- Variances, special permits, and conditional approvals
- Zoning report review (limitations, survey integration)
- Flood zone designation (SFHA, mandatory flood insurance statutes)

- Recommended actions by severity

### Loan Document Provisions Checklist
- Representations and warranties (zoning compliance, CO validity, flood zone, ADA, historic designation)
- Affirmative covenants (maintain compliance, maintain COs, notify lender of violations)
- Negative covenants (no change of use, no actions triggering loss of vested rights)
- Closing conditions (zoning report, COs, flood zone certification, flood insurance evidence)
- Events of default (loss of CO, material zoning violation, loss of vested rights)

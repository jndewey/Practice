## Closing Mechanics

### Timing and Format

- Closings can occur in person (at seller's or counsel's offices) but **escrow
  closings are more common**.
- Select a closing time early enough for wire transfers to credit to seller's bank
  the same day.
- The closing date is usually a **date certain**. Include optional mutual adjournment
  language if flexibility is needed.
- **Time of the essence** applies unilaterally to all buyer obligations.

### Seller Preparation

Before closing, seller's counsel must verify:
- Possession of every document listed as a closing deliverable
- Each item is accurately described in the agreement
- Each item is a fully executed, signed original (certified or acknowledged if required)
- Each item is in duplicate if required
- No missing pages, exhibits, or schedules
- A signatory will be available on closing day for any additional signatures
- All documents can be delivered in time

**Best practice**: Circulate closing documents for signature as early as practicable.
Put all signature blocks on a **separate unnumbered page** so pagination changes
don't require re-execution.

### Adjournment Rights

- Parties can mutually agree to change the closing date.
- Seller cannot unilaterally adjourn unless that right is reserved in the agreement.
- If any possibility of document delivery delays exists, seller should reserve a
  **one-time right to a reasonable adjournment** to avoid triggering buyer's
  termination right.

## Escrow Closing Procedures

If the transaction closes in escrow, the seller should:

1. **Appoint or approve** the escrow agent.
2. Enter into a **formal escrow letter agreement** that details:
   - Closing procedures
   - Escrow agent's duties regarding document inspection, fund verification,
     and distribution
   - Parties' instructions and authorizations
   - Escrow agent's exculpation from liability (except for negligence)
3. Make the **buyer a party** to the escrow agreement.
4. Deliver the seller's signed counterpart to the **escrow agent only** (not the buyer).
5. **Prohibit** the escrow agent from circulating the seller's signed counterpart
   until it confirms receipt of the deposit.

## Seller's Closing Deliverables

### Required Deliverables

| # | Document | Quantity | Notes |
|---|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Assignment and Assumption Agreement | 4 originals | Executed and acknowledged |
| 2 | Original Loan Documents (per Schedule 2) | Originals | Lost note affidavit + copy acceptable for missing notes; court-certified copy acceptable for missing security instruments |
| 3 | Allonge(s) to Promissory Note(s) | 1 per note | Endorses note to buyer |
| 4 | Assignment(s) of Security Instrument(s) | 1 per instrument | Executed, acknowledged, in recordable form |
| 5 | Third-Party Notices | 1 original each | Borrower notice (Exhibit E); taxing authority notice (Exhibit F, if applicable) |
| 6 | UCC-3 Assignment(s) | 1 per UCC-1 | Standardized form; not signed |
| 7 | Escrow/reserve balances | Cash transfer | If applicable; see prorations section |

### Optional Additional Deliverables

| Document | When to Include |
|----------|----------------|
| FIRPTA certificate | Recommended even though seller represents in §5(d) |
| Payoff letter | When sale is at or near par value |
| Title policy original | If in seller's possession (signed original with endorsements) |
| Survey original | If in seller's possession (including PDF copy if available) |
| Construction agreements/reports | If applicable and assignable |
| Servicer release agreement | If third-party servicer is involved |
| Closing statement | Showing final purchase price calculations |

### Lost Notes

If the original promissory note cannot be located:
- Seller delivers a **lost note affidavit** with an attached copy of the note.
- Most states codify procedures for proving a lost note's existence.
- Seller's counsel should request early confirmation that original notes can be
  located to prepare in advance.

## Buyer's Closing Deliverables

| # | Document | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | Purchase price | Wire transfer of immediately available funds |
| 2 | Certificates of formation and good standing | State-certified; updated from execution date |
| 3 | Officer's certificate / secretary's certificate | With resolutions, organizational documents, and incumbency |
| 4 | Executed counterpart of Assignment and Assumption Agreement | Matching seller's version |
| 5 | Information for third-party notices | Contact details, payment instructions for borrower notice |

## Assignment and Assumption Agreement

### Purpose and Nature

- **Bilateral agreement** (both parties sign)—unlike security instrument assignments
  which are unilateral.
- Main purpose: evidence the buyer's assumption of all seller/lender duties under
  the loan(s) and release the seller from all obligations.
- Benefits the buyer because some property contracts condition performance and notice
  obligations on evidence of formal loan assumption.

### Key Provisions

| Provision | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| Preamble | Identifies assignor (seller) and assignee (buyer); effective date |
| Assignment | Assignor assigns all rights, title, and interests in the loan(s) and loan documents |
| Assumption | Assignee assumes all obligations, liabilities, and responsibilities |
| AS-IS; No Recourse | Sale is without representations except as in the loan sale agreement |
| Release | Assignee releases assignor from all obligations as of effective date |
| Governing law | Same as the loan sale agreement |
| Merger | All seller duties deemed fulfilled at closing |

### Formatting Requirements

- **Acknowledged** (notarized) even though not typically recorded—allows recording
  if later needed.
- **Not signed until closing**. If closing in escrow, deliver an undated version to
  the escrow agent in advance.
- 4 original counterparts.

### Recording Considerations

This document is **not in recordable form** by default. If recording is contemplated:
- Add legal property descriptions
- Ensure compliance with local recording requirements
- May need additional formatting changes

## Allonge to Promissory Note

### Purpose

An allonge is an endorsement that makes the buyer the payee of the promissory note.
It evidences the chain of ownership of the instrument.

### Key Rules

- **One allonge per note**—each promissory note gets its own allonge.
- Allonges are **inseparable from the note**—they travel with the note and evidence
  the instrument's chain of custody.
- Executed by the seller/assignor only.
- Should reference the specific note by date, original amount, and parties.

### State-Specific Considerations

Allonge forms may vary by state. Verify compliance with applicable UCC provisions
governing negotiable instruments in the relevant jurisdiction.

## Assignment of Security Instrument

### Purpose

Transfers the lender's interest in the mortgage, deed of trust, or other security
instrument to the buyer.

### Key Requirements

- **Unilateral instrument**—only the seller/assignor executes.
- Must be **executed and acknowledged** (notarized).
- Must be in **recordable form** for the county where the mortgaged property is located.
- Must comply with **applicable state and local recording requirements** (format, font
  size, margin requirements, etc.).
- One assignment per security instrument.

### Multi-State Portfolios

For loans secured by properties in different states, each assignment must comply
with the recording requirements of the state and county where that particular
property is located. This may require different forms for different jurisdictions.

### Recording

Assignment should be recorded with the county recorder's office where the property
is located. Recording is typically handled by the escrow agent or buyer's counsel
post-closing.

## UCC-3 Assignments

### Purpose

Transfers the lender's security interest in personal property collateral securing
the loan(s).

### Key Points

- **Not signed**—the form is standardized (UCC-3 Financing Statement).
- Filed at the **state level** (not county)—different from security instrument
  assignments which are recorded at the county level.
- Pertains to **personal property** (not real property).
- One UCC-3 per UCC-1 financing statement.
- Escrow agent may decline to file or impose additional fees for this service.

## Third-Party Notices

### Notice to Borrower (Exhibit E)

- **Required** under most loan sale agreements.
- Should be sent by the **seller** (not the buyer) because borrowers typically
  won't follow payment instructions from unknown parties.
- Contents: identifies the new lender, provides new payment instructions, effective date.
- Seller prepares the form; buyer provides contact and payment information.

### Notice to Taxing Authorities (Exhibit F)

- **Optional**—required only if a real property tax escrow exists.
- Redirects communications about property taxes to the new lender.

### Additional Notices to Consider

Depending on transaction specifics:
- Construction loan parties (if construction loan)
- Subordinate lenders (if subordinate debt exists)
- Other parties identified during due diligence

## Prorations and Adjustments

### When Prorations Apply

| Sale Type | Prorations |
|-----------|-----------|
| Deep discount, fixed price | Typically none |
| Near-par or par value | Income and/or expenses prorated |
| % of outstanding balance | Usually prorated |

### Common Proration Items

- Accrued interest (from last payment date to closing/cutoff date)
- Prepaid interest
- Late fees collected
- Escrow and reserve account balances
- Operating expenses (if the loan includes management obligations)

### Valuation/Cutoff Date

- **Single loan**: Typically the closing date.
- **Portfolio sale**: Cutoff date before closing to allow time for calculations.
  Parties may adjust again post-closing for the period between cutoff and closing.

### Escrow and Reserve Balances

These funds do not belong to the lender—they are applied according to the loan
documents. Options:

1. **Transfer balances to buyer at closing** (preferred)—no purchase price adjustment
   needed. Buyer agrees to reestablish accounts post-closing.
2. **Do not transfer**—buyer receives a purchase price credit to reestablish accounts.

The agreement should include a closing date acknowledgment of all final account balances.

## Transaction Costs

### Default Allocation

| Cost | Responsible Party |
|------|------------------|
| Seller's legal fees | Seller |
| Buyer's legal fees | Buyer |
| Recording fees (security instrument assignments) | Buyer |
| Transfer/mortgage taxes (if applicable) | Buyer |
| Escrow agent fees | Buyer |
| Title search fees | Buyer |
| UCC search and filing fees | Buyer |
| All other transaction costs | Buyer |

## Remedies for Default

### Deposit as Exclusive Remedy

The deposit serves as the parties' **sole and exclusive remedy**:

**Buyer defaults** (fails to close):
- Seller retains the deposit as liquidated damages.
- No further obligations between the parties.

**Seller defaults** (cannot close):
- Deposit is refunded to the buyer.
- Seller may reserve a one-time right to adjourn closing for a reasonable period
  before the buyer can invoke this remedy.
- No further obligations between the parties.

### No Specific Performance

This standard framework does **not** provide for specific performance by either
party—the deposit mechanism is the complete remedy.

## Post-Closing Obligations

### Surviving Obligations

The loan sale agreement is designed to terminate at closing with minimal surviving
obligations:

| Obligation | Survives? |
|-----------|----------|
| General post-closing cooperation | Yes |
| Broker fee indemnification (§6(h)) | Yes |
| No-access indemnification (§4(c)) | Yes |
| Confidentiality obligations | Yes (if in the agreement) |
| Seller representations and warranties | No |
| All other seller obligations | No |

### Post-Closing Seller Actions

- Send borrower notice of sale
- Send taxing authority notice (if tax escrow)
- Notify loan servicers, administrators, consultants
- Coordinate with buyer on any post-closing accounting adjustments

### Post-Closing Buyer Actions

- Contact title insurer to confirm continuing coverage; request endorsement if desired
- Contact property insurers to update mortgagee information
- Send demand letter to borrower directing notification of:
  - Tenants (via SNDA notices)
  - Property managers
  - Easement holders
  - Other interested parties
- Ensure compliance with all loan document notice requirements when contacting borrower
- If applicable, engage new loan servicer
- Record assignments of security instruments
- File UCC-3 assignments
- Reestablish escrow and reserve accounts (if transferred)

### Separate Post-Closing Agreements

Contractual obligations that continue after closing—such as loan servicing, ongoing
litigation cooperation, construction management, or property management transitions—
should be documented in **separate agreements** that survive the closing independently
of the loan sale agreement.

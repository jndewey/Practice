## 1. Purpose and Importance

The intercreditor agreement governs the relationship between mortgage and mezzanine lenders when both are in the capital stack. It is arguably more vital to the mezzanine lender because a mortgage foreclosure can wipe out the entire mezzanine loan, while a mezzanine foreclosure does not affect the mortgage loan or the mortgage lender's lien.

The intercreditor agreement mitigates drawbacks of a complex capital stack by establishing rights, procedures, and limitations for both lenders regarding cure rights, purchase rights, property control, collateral protection, enforcement timing, and conflict resolution.

## 2. Protections for Mezzanine Lender

### Curing Mortgage Loan Defaults

The most direct protection against first-loss position. Mezzanine lenders negotiate:

- **Notice rights**: Receive copies of all default notices sent to the mortgage borrower simultaneously. Important: specifically request notice of payment defaults, since most mortgage documents do not require payment default notices.
- **Cure periods**: Typically 10 additional days for payment defaults, 30 days for performance defaults, beyond the mortgage borrower's own cure period.
- **Incurable defaults**: Some performance defaults cannot be cured directly; the mezzanine lender may need to cure them indirectly through control of the mezzanine borrower, by foreclosing to gain control of the mortgage borrower, or by purchasing the mortgage loan.

**Limitations on cure rights** — cures are almost never open-ended. Mortgage lenders typically impose:
- A cumulative maximum over the mortgage loan term
- A maximum number over any consecutive 12-month period
- A maximum number of consecutive months
- Combinations of these variables

The purpose of these limits is to prevent the mortgage loan from entering a perpetual cycle of defaults and cures that indefinitely delays the mortgage lender's enforcement.

### Purchasing the Mortgage Loan

Second line of defense against first-loss position. Key parameters:

- **Exercise window**: Generally available no earlier than occurrence of an event of default and no later than commencement of mortgage lender's enforcement action.
- **Purchase price**: The main negotiating point. Mezzanine lenders want par value (outstanding principal + accrued interest at regular rate). Items typically excluded from par:
  - Late charges
  - Default rate interest
  - Prepayment premiums or yield maintenance
  - Exit fees
  - Administrative and enforcement fees, including protective advances
- **Sponsor affiliate issues**: If the purchaser of mezzanine collateral is affiliated with the sponsor, waiving prepayment premiums would be a windfall — allowing the borrower to avoid fees agreed to at origination. CMBS loans add complexity because some fees and servicing amounts are guaranteed to the servicer and cannot be waived.
- **Price formula**: The intercreditor agreement establishes conditions, limitations, and formulas for computing purchase price based on transaction specifics and party relationship.

### Anti-Dilution of Mezzanine Collateral

Mortgage documents routinely permit amendments and modifications, but these can dilute mezzanine collateral value. The tension:

- **Mezzanine lender wants**: Consent rights over all mortgage modifications.
- **Mortgage lender wants**: Unfettered modification rights.
- **Common compromise**: Modifications permitted without mezzanine consent if they are contemplated under the loan documents and do not directly and adversely affect the mezzanine collateral value or mezzanine loan enforcement.

### Control of Mortgaged Property

Mezzanine lenders seek control rights (generally secondary to the mortgage lender) over:
- Major lease approvals and amendments/terminations
- Property manager designation and replacement
- Tenant estoppel requests
- Casualty loss adjustment negotiations
- Condemnation award proceedings

The scope depends on the comparative negotiating strength of the lenders.

## 3. Protections for Mortgage Lender

### New Sponsorship Requirements

After mezzanine foreclosure, the mezzanine lender replaces the original sponsor. The intercreditor agreement typically requires the successor to:
- Satisfy specific financial tests (creditworthiness)
- Demonstrate sufficient experience operating similar properties
- In CMBS loans, satisfy rating agency requirements

### Property Management Control

- If the existing manager is sponsor-affiliated, both lenders typically want it replaced — but the mortgage lender reserves approval over the replacement.
- If the existing manager is an independent third party, the mortgage lender may object to replacement with a mezzanine-lender-affiliated entity, especially if the mortgage lender or tenants have a positive relationship with the current manager.

### Requiring a New Guarantor

The intercreditor agreement typically requires the mezzanine lender to replace the loan guarantor and indemnitor with an entity having net assets and liquidity equal to or greater than the former guarantor. This is critical because a controlling entity with no guaranty liability has no incentive to keep the mortgage borrower out of bankruptcy.

### Delays in Administration and Enforcement

To protect against unreasonable interference, the intercreditor agreement routinely:
- Establishes time limitations on mezzanine lender's cure, enforcement, purchase, and approval rights
- Allows the mortgage lender to act without mezzanine approval in emergencies
- Requires the mezzanine lender to act reasonably
- Allows cash traps to trigger on event of default
- Cuts off the mezzanine lender's purchase right once the mortgage lender commences foreclosure

### Interference Mitigation

Operating conflicts the intercreditor agreement should address:
- Disagreements on property operating budgets
- Lease approval timing in competitive markets
- Cash trap release conditions
- Replacement tenant acceptability
- Application of insurance/condemnation proceeds (especially near loan maturity)

Generally, the mortgage lender has the last word because of its superior lien and direct security interest in the property.

## 4. Key Negotiation Dynamics

### Multiple Lender Coordination

Having multiple lenders creates operational friction for the sponsor:
- Delays obtaining required approvals
- Increased transactional costs
- Redundancies (multiple escrows, duplicative reporting)
- Inconsistencies between loan terms

**Mitigation strategies** sponsors should negotiate:
- Delegate specific approvals to a single lender
- Coordinate timing and scope of reporting
- Waive escrows to the extent duplicated by the other lender
- Coordinate key operating provisions and rights

### Cure Rights Interaction

The mezzanine lender's cure rights exist in addition to the cure rights built into the mortgage loan documents. Together they can frustrate the mortgage lender's enforcement timeline by keeping the loan in perpetual default-and-cure cycles. This is the primary reason mortgage lenders limit the number of cures.

### Mezzanine Loan Maturity Considerations

- If the mezzanine loan matures before the mortgage loan, a maturity default can trigger a payment default under the mortgage loan.
- If coterminous, refinancing the mortgage may not be possible unless the mezzanine loan can be simultaneously repaid or refinanced.

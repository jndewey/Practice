## Overview

Loan sale due diligence is critical because the loan sale agreement typically has few,
if any, seller representations and warranties. The buyer is purchasing "AS-IS" with
no recourse against the seller. Due diligence is the buyer's only protection.

The extent of due diligence depends on:
- Length of the due diligence period
- Amount the buyer is willing to spend
- Quality of materials provided by the seller
- Age of the loan (older loans = more likely outdated information)

Counsel's role is to give the buyer feedback on materials reviewed and—critically—
to identify what may be **missing** from the files. Incomplete servicing files are
common.

## Scope and Limitations

Loan sale due diligence is more limited than real property sale due diligence because:
- Buyer has **no access** to the property for inspections or testing.
- Buyer may **not contact** the borrower, guarantors, tenants, or property manager.
- Buyer relies on: (1) loan documents, (2) seller-provided materials, (3) publicly
  available information.

This makes the negotiation of the due diligence materials list as important as
negotiating the loan sale agreement itself.

## Due Diligence Period

- Typically **2–10 business days** (much shorter than real property transactions).
- Buyer has **unconditional right to terminate** before expiration.
- After expiration, deposit becomes non-refundable (except for seller default).
- Time is of the essence for exercising termination rights.
- A specific date is preferable to "X days from" a trigger event.

**Best practice**: Begin independent due diligence (online searches, public records)
as early as possible—even before the agreement is signed. Information uncovered
during the bidding process can inform contract negotiations.

## Materials List Negotiation

### Starting Point

Use the loan closing binder index as a foundation. A closing binder typically contains:
- Loan documents (note, mortgage/deed of trust, guaranties, etc.)
- Borrower certifications and affidavits (with all exhibits)
- Final signed mortgagee title policy with endorsements
- Final certified ALTA survey
- Property condition report(s)
- Phase I environmental assessment
- Legal opinion(s)
- Resolutions and incumbency certificates for borrower/guarantor entities
- Unrecorded SNDAs
- Closing statement
- Construction agreements, drawings, renderings (construction loans only)

### Additional Buyer Requests

Beyond closing binder items, request the entire servicing file including:
- Loan payment history
- Financial statements and reporting submitted by borrower
- Property operating statements, rent rolls, and budgets
- Tenant estoppels (even if outdated—historical data reveals trends)
- Escrow and reserve account statements
- Correspondence files (non-privileged)
- Insurance certificates and policies
- Default notices sent or received

### Seller Exclusions

Sellers typically exclude:
- Internal work product (reports, analyses, memoranda, valuations)
- Attorney-client privileged communications
- Credit reports and analyses on obligors or tenants
- Regulatory reports
- Internal appraisals (considered central to loan valuation)

**Buyer pushback**: Argue for all nonconfidential information, including historical
documents. Even outdated materials help identify changes, trends, and deficiencies.

### Special Property Types

| Property Type | Additional Materials |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Construction loans | Developer/contractor/architect agreements, plans, drawings, reports |
| Hotel loans | Franchise agreements, comfort letters, management agreements |
| Retail/office | Lease abstracts, tenant financial statements, CAM reconciliations |

## Fact-Specific Due Diligence Focus

The focus shifts depending on loan status:

| Loan Status | Primary Focus Areas |
|------------|-------------------|
| Performing loan | Material adverse changes since origination |
| Defaulted loan | Loan enforceability, remedies available, lien priority |
| Environmental issues | Environmental reports, O&M programs (even though testing is prohibited) |
| Foreclosure candidate | Borrower financial condition, property value, enforcement strategies |
| Portfolio sale | Individual loan analysis plus portfolio-level risk assessment |

## Main Areas of Investigation

### 1. Borrower Financial Condition

Evaluate financial condition of borrower, guarantors, and indemnitors to determine
if any party has sought or is likely to seek debtor protection. Compare and analyze:
- Financial statements
- Tax returns
- Online and public record searches

### 2. Loan Document and File Review

Review loan documents and due diligence materials to:
- Verify all security instruments were properly recorded and mortgage lien was perfected
- Verify the lender reserved all available rights and remedies
- Identify drafting deficiencies (errors, ambiguities, unenforceable provisions)
- Identify risks and potential liabilities of loan assumption
- Confirm borrower's debt service payment history
- Confirm whether a default exists or notice of default has been sent/received/threatened

### 3. Title Review

Conduct a current title search to verify that since the mortgagee title policy date:
- Neither the loan nor the property has been transferred
- No unpermitted liens or encumbrances have been recorded
- No intervening lien has attained priority over the recorded mortgage

### 4. Property Condition and Income Analysis

Evaluate through available documentation:
- Property condition reports
- Environmental reports and O&M protocols
- Appraisals and broker opinions (if available)
- Operating statements
- Escrow and reserve account deposit/payment history
- Leasing files

### 5. Lien and Litigation Status

Analyze through:
- Loan documents and servicing files
- Mortgagee title policy and title update
- Online and public record searches
- Court docket review for pending enforcement actions or litigation

### 6. Lease and Tenant Analysis

Review:
- Rent rolls (current and historical—compare trends)
- Lease abstracts and actual leases
- SNDAs
- Tenant estoppels (even outdated ones)
- Tenant financial statements (if available)
- CAM reconciliations (commercial properties)

## Public Record and Online Searches

### Online Searches

Search for pertinent information about the seller, borrower, property, and major
tenants through:
- News sources
- Government websites
- Corporate/entity websites
- Social media
- Court electronic filing systems

### Public Record Searches

| Search Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Title search | Current state of real property title; tax and assessment status |
| Judgment/lien search | Disputes, litigation, judgments, fines, liens |
| Bankruptcy search | Debtor proceedings involving borrower, guarantors, major tenants |
| UCC search | Evidence of other indebtedness; competing security interests |
| OFAC/Patriot Act | Federal compliance verification |
| Court docket review | Pending litigation, enforcement actions, government investigations |

**Note**: A title search is merely a report—it does not insure title or obligate the
title company to issue a policy. Liability is limited to the cost of the search.

## Evaluating Loan Files

Most closing-era material consists of third-party reports that are outdated and may
no longer be accurate:
- Closing certificates
- Legal opinions (not transferable to buyer)
- Tenant estoppels
- Financial statements
- Property reports

The property condition report and Phase I environmental are certified to the seller
only—certifications do not extend to successors. Legal opinions cannot be relied
upon by the buyer.

## Extrapolating Information from Multiple Sources

Because due diligence is limited, the buyer must cross-reference and triangulate
information from multiple sources:

| Category | Sources to Cross-Reference |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Legal opinions | Identify exceptions/qualifications re: enforceability, usury, corporate authority, substantive consolidation, zoning |
| Borrower representations | Compare loan documents, closing certificates, title affidavits, post-closing certificates in servicing files |
| Property income | Compare rent rolls, budgets, and leasing files for discrepancies |
| Property condition | Analyze condition reports, operating statements, escrow/reserve history, leasing files |
| Borrower financial status | Compare financial statements, tax returns, and public searches |
| Loan and lien status | Analyze loan documents, servicing files, title policy/update, public searches |

## Transferable Materials

### Mortgagee Title Policy

**Automatic coverage**: For policies with jacket dates of **2006 or later**, the
buyer is automatically insured as the lender's successor **unless** the buyer is
related to the borrower or loan guarantors.

**Best practice**: Contact the title insurer to confirm continuing coverage. Consider
requesting a written confirmation or policy endorsement (subject to state regulations
and company policy).

**Notice**: While not technically required for 2006+ policies, most buyers notify
the insurer post-closing (or earlier if the title company serves as escrow agent).

### ALTA Survey

Transferable to successor lender. Buyer may be able to conduct visual observations
from the ground and use drone photography for aerial inspection, even though
physical property access is prohibited.

## Portfolio Sale Considerations

- Determine if the sale is all-or-nothing or if the buyer may drop individual loans.
- If drop rights exist, each property needs a separate allocated base purchase price.
- The right to drop loans should have a deadline preceding the closing date.
- Each loan should receive individual due diligence analysis.
- Consider creating a risk matrix summarizing findings across the portfolio.

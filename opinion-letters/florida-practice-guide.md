# Florida Legal Opinion Practice Guide

Distilled from the Florida Bar's "Report on Third-Party Legal Opinion Customary
Practice in Florida" (Dec. 3, 2011, with First Supplement July 24, 2021),
Form B (real estate secured loan opinion), and Form D (local counsel opinion).

---

## 1. Entity Status Opinions — Florida Entities

### Corporations (Ch. 607, Fla. Stat.)
- Florida does not use "good standing" certificates. The Department of State issues
  "Certificates of Status" confirming the entity is "active."
- The opinion should state the entity is "organized under Florida law, and its
  corporate status is active" — NOT "in good standing."
- Diligence: Review articles of incorporation, certificate of status from FL DOS.
- The 2019 amendments to Ch. 607 significantly revised the Florida Business
  Corporation Act. Key changes include updated provisions on director duties,
  shareholder rights, and corporate governance.

### Limited Liability Companies (Ch. 605, Fla. Stat. — FL Revised LLC Act)
- Adopted in 2013, effective January 1, 2014 (with transition through 2015).
- The opinion states the LLC is "organized under Florida law" with "active" status.
- Operating agreements are not filed publicly. Diligence requires review of the
  operating agreement provided by the client.
- Under §605.0304, an LLC's operating agreement governs relations among members,
  managers, and the LLC itself.

### Limited Partnerships (Ch. 620, Fla. Stat.)
- Certificate of limited partnership is filed with FL DOS.
- Review the limited partnership agreement for power/authority opinions.
- The LP dissolution assumption is important — include assumption that no event
  has resulted in dissolution.

### Land Trusts (§689.071, Fla. Stat.)
- Revised in 2013. Florida land trusts are used frequently in real estate.
- The trustee holds legal title; beneficiaries hold personal property interests.
- Special considerations for opinion letters involving trust entities.

## 2. Foreign Qualification Opinions

- Based solely on certificates of status from the FL Department of State.
- Use "authorized to transact business" language, with "active" status.
- The certificate confirms qualification as of its date; include the assumption
  that it remains accurate as of the opinion date.
- Per the H&K form and Appendix B: "Based solely on certificates of public
  officials described in Schedule I.C hereto (which, with your permission, we
  assume remain accurate as of the date hereof), each Relevant Party is authorized
  to transact business in the State of Florida, and such status is active."

## 3. Power and Authorization Opinions

- Diligence: Review organizational documents AND authorizing resolutions.
- For corporations: review articles, bylaws, board resolutions (and shareholder
  resolutions if required by articles or statute).
- For LLCs: review articles of organization, operating agreement, and
  member/manager consent or resolutions.
- For LPs: review certificate of LP, LP agreement, and GP authorization.
- Presumption of regularity applies — no need to review entire minute book.

## 4. Execution and Delivery

- The opinion confirms that each Transaction Document has been "executed and
  delivered" by the Relevant Party.
- Under Florida practice, "execution" means the document has been signed.
  "Delivery" means the signed document has been transmitted or made available
  with the intent to give it legal effect.
- Per Form B: "We did not physically witness the execution and delivery of the
  Transaction Documents, and our opinions herein regarding the execution and
  delivery... are based, in part, on [certificates to counsel / copies of
  executed signature pages provided to us]."

## 5. Enforceability (Remedies) Opinion

### Core Formulation
"Each of the Transaction Documents to which [the Borrower/Relevant Party] is a
party is a valid and binding obligation of [the Borrower/Relevant Party],
enforceable against [the Borrower/Relevant Party] in accordance with its terms."

### Standard Exceptions
Always subject to:
1. **Bankruptcy Exception**: bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
   fraudulent conveyance and transfer, and similar law affecting creditors' rights.
2. **Equitable Principles Limitation**: general principles of equity, regardless of
   whether enforceability is considered at law or in equity.

### Remedies Qualification — Florida "Golden Nugget" Approach
Per Form B, despite potential unenforceability of specific provisions, the core
obligations remain enforceable:
- (i) judicial enforcement of repayment of principal plus interest (to extent not
  deemed a penalty);
- (ii) acceleration upon material default in payment or any other material provision;
- (iii) foreclosure of the lien on real property collateral upon maturity or
  acceleration.

### Specific Provisions Excluded from Enforceability Opinion
Florida practice (per Form B) excludes opinion on enforceability of:
- Provisions excusing liability for own acts
- Provisions making void any act in contravention
- Sole discretion / conclusive determination provisions
- Written waiver/amendment requirements
- Waivers of constitutional, statutory or equitable rights, statutes of limitations,
  unknown future defenses, rights to damages
- Liquidated damages, receivers, penalties, indemnification for gross negligence/
  willful misconduct, confessions of judgment, self-help, forfeiture
- Mitigation of damages limitations
- Choice of forum, jurisdiction, venue, service of process, jury trial waivers,
  arbitration
- Usury savings clauses
- Attorney's fee provisions (limited by FL statutes)
- Evidentiary standard provisions
- Non-compete, non-solicitation, restraint of trade provisions
- Cumulative/non-exclusive remedies provisions
- Severability provisions
- No-notice exercise of rights
- Setoff provisions beyond applicable law
- Blanket assignment prohibitions
- Specific performance provisions

### Guaranty-Specific Notes
A guarantor may be discharged if:
- Lender action impairs collateral value to guarantor's detriment
- Lender elects remedies that impair guarantor's subrogation rights
- Guaranteed debt is materially modified
- Lender otherwise takes action that materially prejudices the guarantor

## 6. No Violation / No Breach or Default

### No Violation of Organizational Documents — Opinion 5(a)
- Straightforward comparison of transaction against org docs.

### No Violation of Applicable Laws — Opinion 5(b)
- Limited to "Applicable Laws" as defined (with standard exclusions).
- Does NOT include an opinion on compliance with all laws generally.

### No Breach of Applicable Contracts — Opinion 5(c)
- Only if specifically requested. Limited to contracts listed in a schedule.
- Financial ratio/test exclusion is critical — always exclude.
- Cross-default exclusion for defaults under non-Applicable Contracts.

### No Violation of Judgments/Decrees — Opinion 5(d)
- Only for orders listed in a schedule.

## 7. No Required Governmental Consents — Opinion 6

- Limited to execution, delivery, and closing (not ongoing business operations).
- Expressly carve out conduct-of-business authorizations.
- List any required consents that have been obtained in Schedule I.F.

## 8. Florida Usury

### Statutory Framework
- §687.02, Fla. Stat.: Maximum rate of 18% per annum simple interest for loans
  of $500,000 or less.
- §687.071, Fla. Stat.: Maximum rate of 25% per annum simple interest for loans
  exceeding $500,000 (criminal usury threshold).
- Interest calculated on basis of 365-day year (or 366 as applicable) and actual
  days elapsed.

### Opinion Formulation (from Appendix B)
"The [Note] and the interest provided for therein will not violate the usury laws
of the State of Florida, provided that the [Lender] has not and does not reserve,
charge, take, or receive, directly or indirectly, at any time, interest or other
sums deemed to be in the nature of interest in an amount exceeding the equivalent
of the rate of [18%/25%] simple interest per year, calculated on the basis of a
365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed."

### Key Considerations
- "Interest" under Florida law includes any charges, fees, or other consideration
  that are deemed to be in the nature of interest.
- The opinion is conditioned on the lender not exceeding the maximum rate.
- The applicable rate depends on the loan amount ($500K threshold).

## 9. Choice of Law Opinions

### Florida Conflicts Analysis
Florida courts apply the "normal and reasonable relationship" test from:
- **Continental Mortgage Investors v. Sailboat Key, Inc.**, 395 So.2d 507 (Fla. 1981)
- **Morgan Walton Properties, Inc. v. Int'l City Bank & Trust Co.**, 404 So.2d 1059
  (Fla. 1981)

### Factors Supporting "Normal Relationship"
(per Sailboat Key / Morgan Walton):
- Lender organized under laws of chosen jurisdiction
- Lender domiciled and has offices in chosen jurisdiction
- Documents executed and delivered in chosen jurisdiction
- Loan funded from and repaid in chosen jurisdiction

### Opinion Formulation (from Appendix B)
Use "more likely than not" language:
"The choice of law provisions... specifying [governing law] law... would more
likely than not be recognized and enforced by a state or federal court sitting
in and applying the choice of law principles of the State of Florida [assuming
that the transaction bears a reasonable relationship to the State of (governing
law jurisdiction)]..."

### Standard Exceptions to Choice of Law
A Florida court may nonetheless apply Florida law if:
(a) the issue involves interest rate limitations or usury;
(b) application of chosen law violates a fundamental/public policy of Florida;
(c) the issue involves creation, enforceability, and constructive notice of liens
    against real property located outside the chosen jurisdiction;
(d) the issue involves perfection of security interests in personal property;
(e) UCC §1-105(2) otherwise provides; or
(f) a provision is deemed procedural rather than substantive.

### Usury-Specific Choice of Law
The Sailboat Key opinion specifically addressed choice of validating usury law.
If the lender may NOT be organized/domiciled with its only office in the chosen
jurisdiction, the opinion should note that "we cannot say with certainty that a
sufficiently 'normal relationship' exists."

### Assumption for Choice of Law Opinion
Include factual assumptions supporting the normal relationship, such as:
- Negotiations occurred in the chosen jurisdiction
- Lender offices located there
- Primary counsel located there
- Relevant Parties traveled there for negotiations
- Loan records maintained there
- Loan funded from and repaid to that jurisdiction

## 10. Florida Transaction Taxes

### Documentary Stamp Tax (Ch. 201, Fla. Stat.)
- Imposed on promissory notes and mortgages.
- Rate: $0.35 per $100 (or fraction thereof) on notes.
- Rate: $0.35 per $100 on mortgage amount for recording.

### Nonrecurring Intangible Tax (§199.133, Fla. Stat.)
- 2 mills ($0.002) per dollar of obligation secured by Florida real property.
- Due within 30 days of document date if mortgage recorded in Florida.

### Tax Payment Opinions
Three common formulations (from Appendix B):
1. **No tax due** (out-of-state execution): "No Florida documentary stamp tax is
   payable... by virtue of the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents..."
2. **Correct amount stated**: "The 'Notice to Recorder' clause on the first page
   of the [Mortgage] reflects the correct amounts of Florida documentary stamp tax
   and Florida nonrecurring intangible tax..."
3. **Consequences of non-payment**: Failure to pay renders the document
   unenforceable until paid (plus interest, penalties), but does NOT affect the
   validity of the lien or constructive notice from recording.

### Tax Assumption
For out-of-state delivery: assume documents "are not and will not be made,
executed, delivered, sold, transferred, or assigned in the State of Florida" and
no mortgage or security instrument (other than UCC filings) will be filed/recorded
in Florida.

## 11. Real Property Lien Opinions

### Mortgage Lien
"The Mortgage is effective to create a valid lien in favor of the Lender in the
Real Property Collateral. Upon the proper recording of the Mortgage in the [Local
Filing Office], the Mortgage will provide constructive notice of the lien."

### Assignment of Leases and Rents
Same structure as mortgage lien opinion, for leases and rents collateral.

### Key Qualifications
- No title opinion is given — assume borrower has good title.
- No priority opinion — relative priority is excluded.
- Property descriptions are assumed to be sufficient.
- Subject to Bankruptcy Exception and Equitable Principles Limitation.
- "Value" has been given is an assumption.

## 12. UCC Fixture Filing Opinions

"The Financing Statement is in acceptable form for filing with the [Local Filing
Office]. Upon the proper filing of the Financing Statement with and acceptance by
the [Local Filing Office], the Lender will have a perfected security interest in
the Fixtures described therein."

### Continuation and Maintenance Notes (from Form B)
Call attention to:
- Continuation statements required within 6 months before 5th anniversary
- Change of debtor location may require re-perfection
- Transfer of collateral to new owner — re-perfection may be needed
- Name change of debtor — amendment required within 4 months
- Failure to respond to debtor request — potential loss of security interest

## 13. Local Counsel Opinions

When acting as local Florida counsel (see Form D):
- Scope is limited to Florida law matters only.
- Assume all matters covered by primary counsel's opinion (entity existence and
  organization under home state law, power, authorization, execution, delivery
  under home state law).
- Give Florida-specific opinions: foreign qualification, enforceability under
  Florida law (or "as if" Florida law applied), no violation of Florida laws,
  mortgage/lien opinions, fixture filing opinions, tax opinions, usury, choice
  of law, lender qualification.
- Use the additional assumption: "That the forms of the Transaction Documents
  executed and delivered at closing are the same as the forms furnished to us."
- For documents governed by non-Florida law (e.g., a NY-governed credit agreement),
  give a conditional enforceability opinion: "if a court were to refuse to apply
  the substantive law of the Selected Jurisdiction and instead were to apply
  Florida law..."

## 14. Lender Qualification to Do Business in Florida

H&K strongly discourages this opinion due to uncertainty in Florida law. The FL
doing business statutes do not expressly address loans. If required:

"Neither the making of the [Loan], nor the ownership of the [Notes], the [Mortgage],
or the other Transaction Documents, nor the enforcement thereof in the State of
Florida, will, solely as the result of such actions, (a) constitute 'doing business'
or require qualification of the Lender in Florida..."

With exceptions for:
- Non-financial-institution lenders (§607.0505 registered office requirement)
- Taking title to or operating Florida collateral
- Mortgage lender licensing requirements (Ch. 494, Fla. Stat.)
- No opinion on other FL activities or physical presence

## 15. Knowledge Standard

"To our knowledge" or "known to us" means:
- Conscious awareness of lawyers in the "primary lawyer group"
- Primary lawyer group = (i) signing lawyer, (ii) lawyers actively preparing the
  opinion, (iii) lawyers actively involved in the transaction
- NO independent investigation implied
- NO firm-wide search, court record search, or client file review implied

## Introductory Paragraph and Recitals

### Introductory Paragraph

Identifies the parties and establishes the effective date, which also begins any due
diligence period. The drafter must:

- Confirm the seller is the **same entity** as the lender identified in the loan
  documents, mortgagee title policy, and any title update.
- If the loan was previously assigned, review all prior assignment documents
  to confirm the chain of custody from origination through sale.
- Use each entity's exact legal name as it appears on the state-issued
  certificate of formation.

### Recitals

Should briefly describe the transaction and state consideration. Critical rules:

- **Avoid** recitals that could be construed as covenants or representations.
- **Avoid** statements that may contradict or create ambiguity with contract provisions.
- The seller should only state what business it is in—**not** represent that it is
  the holder or owner of the loan (that representation belongs in §5).

**Loan Description**: For a single loan, describe it in the recitals. For multiple
loans, describe them on Schedule 1. See the Schedules section below for formatting.

---

## Section 1: Purchase and Sale

Creates the central obligations: seller agrees to sell all loan rights; buyer agrees
to assume all rights and obligations as of closing.

**Key concept**: Unlike real property sales, a loan sale conveys only intangible
rights and interests created in favor of the lender by the loan documents.

**Assignment Option**: If the buyer may designate an affiliate to close, include
optional language defining "Affiliate" and "Control" with the requirement that the
originally named purchaser is not released from obligations.

---

## Section 2: No Recourse; AS-IS Sale

Establishes that the buyer has no recourse against the seller and the sale is
AS-IS, WITH ALL FAULTS, without express or implied representations except those
in §5.

**Risk allocation**: The loan sale reallocates credit risk from seller (existing
lender) to buyer (successor lender). The buyer bears all risk if it miscalculates.

**Specific exclusions** (optional, seller counsel may add): Emphasize the buyer's
exclusive duty to investigate loan status, borrower, real property, and due
diligence material accuracy.

**Prominence**: Some practitioners use solid capitals or bold for the entire section
to make these disclaimers more conspicuous.

---

## Section 3: Purchase Price

### §3(a) Deposit

- Amount at seller's discretion; 10%+ is typical but may be waived between
  institutional lenders.
- Non-refundable after due diligence expires except for seller default.
- No interest payable (loan sales close quickly).
- If closing within 10 days, require wire transfer only (avoid check clearance delays).
- If escrow agent is appointed, ensure agent acknowledges obligations in the agreement.

### §3(b) Balance Due at Closing

- Wire transfer of immediately available funds.
- Payment time should be early enough for same-day bank credit.
- Include proration language if applicable; delete if fixed-price with no adjustments.
- If any loan is cash-managed, ensure sweeps don't interfere with proper allocation.

### Price Structures

| Structure | Typical Context | Proration Language |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Fixed, no adjustments | Sign-and-close; negotiations concluded | Delete proration brackets |
| Fixed with prorations | Due diligence period included | Retain proration language |
| % of outstanding balance | Portfolio sale or discount sale | Requires seller balance representation |

---

## Section 4: Due Diligence

### §4(a) Due Diligence Period

- Typically 2–10 business days.
- Virtual access (online document-sharing) allows period to begin immediately.
- Physical access may require additional days for seller to assemble materials.
- Expiration date should be at least 2 full business days before closing to give
  seller notice time and document preparation time.

**Virtual Access Best Practices**: Appoint a website administrator to upload all
materials; confirm they are correct, complete, and legible; monitor usage; and
troubleshoot. The administrator should not answer content questions—direct those
to the seller's designated representative.

### §4(b) Right of Termination

Unconditional right to terminate for any or no reason before due diligence expires.
Deposit must be returned. If due diligence materials were physically delivered,
include optional language requiring return at buyer's expense.

### §4(c) No Access

Buyer may **not**:
- Enter the mortgaged property
- Contact any loan obligor (borrower, guarantors, indemnitors, property manager)
- Contact any tenant or occupant

Buyer must direct all inquiries to the seller's designated representative. Breach
of no-access triggers indemnification obligation that survives closing.

### §4(d) Due Diligence Materials

Materials are listed on Schedule 4. Select delivery method:
- "Deliver" (mail/ship to buyer)
- "Make available" (inspection at physical location)
- "Make available online" (cloud-based document sharing)

Sellers want to limit; buyers want breadth. The closing binder index is a good
starting point for the materials list.

### §4(e) Excluded Material

Sellers may exclude:
- Internal correspondence, reports, analyses, and memoranda
- Business decisions about the loan
- Communications with servicers, underwriters, consultants, employees
- Regulatory reports
- Valuations and appraisals (considered proprietary/confidential)
- Credit information and analyses on obligors or tenants
- Attorney-client privileged information
- Materials generated in connection with originating/acquiring and administering the loan

**Buyer's counsel** should ensure excluded material is narrowly defined and limited
to seller's own confidential/proprietary information—not borrower information.

### §4(f) Duty of Independent Investigation

Buyer acknowledges:
- Duty to perform due diligence at own expense
- Must review public records and independent sources
- Seller has not independently verified due diligence materials
- Decision to close is buyer's informed, independent decision
- Sale is AS-IS, WITH ALL FAULTS, without recourse

**Minimum independent inquiry**: Updated title report plus searches for liens,
judgments, and other public record matters.

---

## Section 5: Seller Representations

### Core Representations

| §5(a) | Owner of loan; right, power, and authority to sell without third-party consent |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| §5(b) | No prior assignment, transfer, encumbrance, or hypothecation |
| §5(c) | OFAC compliance |
| §5(d) | FIRPTA certification (not a foreign person) |

### Warranties

- Deep discount sales: Seller may refuse all warranties.
- Most transactions: Seller at minimum warrants ownership and right to sell.
- **Never** warrant lien perfection, priority, or enforceability.

**Warranty language**: Consider deleting warranty language from the lead-in sentence
and using it only in specific subsections where it applies.

### Factors Affecting Representations

- More parity between parties = more mirror representations.
- Seller should not represent facts that are independently verifiable or based on
  third-party information (insurance policies, rent rolls, financial statements, etc.).
- Large institutional lenders typically do not provide certificates of formation,
  resolutions, or corporate status proofs—just a blanket power-and-authority statement.

---

## Section 6: Buyer Representations, Warranties, and Covenants

### §6(a) Due Formation, Existence, and Good Standing

Require state-certified certificates at both contract execution and closing.
Certificates are date-sensitive—accept within prior 30 days. Closing date
confirmation can be done online.

### §6(b) Power and Authority

Seller must confirm:
- Buyer has authority to execute and perform
- Person signing has power to bind the buyer
- Requires officer's certificate with formation documents attached

**Limited document review**: Seller confirms organizational documents don't prohibit
the transaction and don't require additional consents—but does not need to evaluate
operational provisions since there's no post-closing business relationship.

### §6(c) No Other Consents, Licenses, or Filings

Buyer confirms no additional authorizations, licenses, or consents are required
(or will be obtained before closing).

**Note**: Buyer's counsel (not seller) is responsible for confirming the buyer
qualifies to transact business and is licensed to hold/service loans in applicable
jurisdictions.

### §6(d) Enforceable Obligations

Acts as estoppel against enforceability challenges. Seller does not require an
enforceability opinion given the contract's limited duration and remedies.

### §6(e) No Legal Conflict, Violation, or Impediment

Negative representation—hard to verify. Sellers should resist buyer requests to
add knowledge or materiality qualifiers.

### §6(f) OFAC Compliance

Both parties must search the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons
List. Fines for noncompliance are punitive.

### §6(g) No Reliance

Buyer confirms financial sophistication and that its decision is independent,
without reliance on seller except for express §5 representations. Add optional
language if buyer is represented by counsel.

### §6(h) Broker's Fees

Default: buyer pays all commissions. Buyer indemnifies seller against broker
claims. This indemnity **survives closing**.

### §6(i) Release of Loan Servicing

Sale is servicer-released. Buyer assumes all servicing obligations. If escrows
and reserves are transferred, buyer agrees to reestablish them post-closing.

### §6(j) Notices to Other Parties

Seller sends notices to borrower and taxing authorities (if tax escrow exists).
Buyer provides information needed to complete notices. Best practice: seller
prepares and sends notices rather than delegating to buyer, because borrowers
typically won't follow payment instructions from unknown parties.

### §6(k) Assignment

**Option 1 – Prohibited**: No assignment, and any change of control constitutes
an assignment. Attempted violations are void ab initio.

**Option 2 – Conditional one-time assignment to affiliate**: Requires delivery
before due diligence expires of: (i) executed assignment and assumption, (ii)
organizational documents proving affiliate status, (iii) formation and good
standing certificates, (iv) resolutions and authorizations. Assignment does not
release the originally named purchaser.

---

## Section 7: Closing

See `closing.md` for detailed deliverables guidance.

### Key Principles

- Closing usually via escrow; select time early enough for same-day wire credit.
- Closing date is typically a date certain; include optional mutual adjournment language.
- Time of the essence applies unilaterally to buyer.
- Seller should reserve a one-time adjournment right if document delays are possible.

### §7(d) Transaction Costs

Default allocation:
- **Seller pays**: Own legal fees
- **Buyer pays**: All other costs including recording fees, transfer taxes,
  escrow agent fees, title searches, and its own legal fees

### §7(e) Remedies

Deposit is the parties' exclusive remedy:
- **Buyer defaults**: Seller retains deposit as liquidated damages.
- **Seller defaults/cannot close**: Deposit refunded to buyer. Seller may
  reserve a one-time right to adjourn closing for a reasonable period.

---

## Section 8: General Provisions

## Schedules and Exhibits

### Schedule 1: Schedule of Loans

- **Single loan**: Describe in recitals; mark Schedule 1 as "Intentionally Deleted."
- **Multiple loans**: Describe each loan with: lender name, borrower name, loan
  amount (original principal for permanent; maximum for construction), effective
  date, and mortgaged property description.

### Schedule 3: Seller's Wiring Instructions

Confirm before finalizing. Verify: bank name, routing information, seller's
legal name, account name and number, and transaction reference line. Seller
reserves the right to amend prior to closing.

Start with the closing binder index. Typical items: loan documents, borrower
certificates, title policy, ALTA survey, property condition reports, Phase I
environmental, legal opinions, resolutions/incumbency certificates, organizational
documents, unrecorded SNDAs, and closing statement. For construction loans, add
construction agreements, plans, and drawings. For hotel loans, add franchise

for the county where the property is located. Unilateral instrument (only seller
executes). Must be acknowledged.

### Exhibit E: Notice of Loan Sale to Borrower

## 1. Due Diligence Scope — Why Mezzanine Is Different

Mezzanine lender due diligence is uniquely comprehensive because the lender succeeds to the pledgor's rights AND obligations on foreclosure. Unlike a mortgage lender (whose foreclosure extinguishes the borrower's interests in the property), a mezzanine lender that forecloses:

- Becomes the sole member and controlling entity of the mortgage borrower
- Takes **subject to** all existing obligations of the mezzanine borrower
- Inherits the mortgage borrower's contractual obligations, liabilities, representations, and indemnities

For this reason, mezzanine due diligence is more analogous to that of a **property purchaser** than a mortgagee. The mezzanine lender must evaluate not just whether the property supports the loan, but what obligations it would inherit if it forecloses.

## 2. Property Evaluation

The mezzanine lender evaluates the mortgaged property even though it takes no security interest in the real property. The property's value directly affects the pledged collateral because:

- The property is the **only asset** of the mortgage borrower
- The property's value determines the value of the mortgage borrower and, by extension, the ownership interests pledged as collateral
- Property rents and income are the **ultimate source** of mezzanine debt service (flowing through distributions from the mortgage borrower to the mezzanine borrower)
- On foreclosure, the mezzanine lender succeeds to indirect ownership and takes subject to existing obligations

### Key Property Diligence Areas
- Appraisal value and current market conditions
- Cash flow analysis and debt service coverage ratios (both mortgage-only and combined)
- Lease analysis (tenant creditworthiness, rollover risk, below-market rents)
- Physical condition and deferred maintenance
- Environmental condition
- Title and survey review
- Zoning compliance
- Insurance adequacy

## 3. Entity Evaluation

Mezzanine lenders conduct due diligence on both the mortgage borrower and mezzanine borrower, focusing on:

### Organizational Structure
- Formation documents (certificates of formation, LLC agreements)
- Good standing certificates
- Authorization to transact business in relevant states
- SPE/bankruptcy-remote compliance (separateness covenants, independent managers)

### Governance
- Who has authority to bind the entities
- Required consents for the mezzanine loan transaction
- Restrictions on transfer of membership interests
- Permitted distributions and cash flow waterfalls

### Compliance
- No existing defaults under organizational documents
- No pending or threatened litigation affecting the entities
- Tax compliance and filing status
- UCC search results (confirm no competing liens on the membership interests)

## 4. Property Reports and Reliance

### Standard Reports

The most common due diligence reports in CRE loans:
- **Property appraisals**
- **Property condition reports** (engineering reports)
- **Phase I environmental assessment** (and Phase II if recommended)
- **Zoning reports**
- **Title insurance commitments and surveys**

### Reliance Issues

To avoid duplicative cost, mezzanine borrowers typically use the same reports for both lenders. Loan counsel must ensure the mezzanine lender can rely on these reports:

- **Addressed to both lenders**: Instruct engineers, consultants, and providers to address reports to both the mortgage lender and mezzanine lender
- **Reliance letters**: If a report is addressed only to the mortgage lender, obtain a reliance letter in favor of the mezzanine lender (usually for an additional fee paid by the mezzanine borrower)
- **Successors and assigns**: Reports must run to each lender's successors and assigns (critical for secondary market sales)

## 5. Personal Contracts

### Why Personal Contracts Matter More for Mezzanine Lenders

Personal contracts (service contracts, management agreements, leasing agreements) do NOT run with the land. A foreclosing mortgage lender does not become a party to them. But a foreclosing mezzanine lender takes subject to all existing obligations of the mezzanine borrower — and through ownership of the mortgage borrower, inherits the mortgage borrower's contractual obligations.

Common outsourced services to review:
- Property leasing
- Property management
- Landscaping
- Waste and snow removal
- HVAC maintenance and repair
- Cleaning and janitorial
- Security services

### What to Evaluate

Mezzanine lenders must analyze payment and performance obligations, liabilities, representations, indemnities, and specific terms. Red flags include contracts that:
- Impose lengthy advance notice periods for termination
- Limit termination rights (e.g., for-cause only)
- Impose personal liability for defaults
- Impute liability for false representations to successors
- Require guarantees by the sponsor
- Require cancellation or break-up fees
- Have stated terms longer than one year

## 6. Mezzanine Lender Protections

### Ground Lease Protections

If the mortgage borrower holds a leasehold estate, the mezzanine lender must obtain an estoppel certificate from the ground lessor confirming:
- The pledge does not violate the ground lease's transfer provisions
- Ground lessor consent is not required (or is given)
- The ground lessor must give notice of defaults before enforcement
- The mezzanine lender has the right to cure defaults before termination (subject to the mortgage lender's superior cure right)
- If the ground lease terminates, the ground lessor will enter into a new lease with the mezzanine lender (subject to mortgage lender's superior rights)

### Insurance Requirements

- **Property insurance**: Confirm adequate coverage; both lenders agree on application of insurance proceeds in the intercreditor agreement
- **Liability insurance**: Each policy must name the mezzanine lender as an additional insured
- **UCC insurance**: Policy insuring the lender's lien on the pledged collateral
- **Mezzanine financing endorsement**: Endorsement to the mortgage borrower's fee title policy giving the mezzanine lender the right to receive title policy proceeds (up to the mezzanine loan amount) before the mortgage borrower

### Legal Opinions

The mezzanine lender requires opinion letters confirming:
- The mezzanine borrower (and each affiliated entity party to the loan documents) is validly formed, in good standing, and duly authorized
- Each mezzanine loan document is enforceable by its terms (subject to standard assumptions, qualifications, and exceptions)
- The mezzanine lender has a valid and perfected security interest in the pledged equity

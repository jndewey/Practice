# Opinion Letter Review Checklist — Lender's Counsel

This checklist provides a systematic section-by-section framework for reviewing
a third-party legal opinion letter received from borrower's counsel. Each item
includes the review point, what to look for, and the severity classification if
the item is deficient.

---

## 1. Preamble / Introductory Paragraph

### 1.1 Opinion Giver Identification
- [ ] Law firm name clearly stated
- [ ] Jurisdiction(s) in which the firm is qualified to practice identified
- [ ] Relationship to borrower stated (outside counsel, special counsel, etc.)
- If described as "special counsel," confirm this is acceptable — it means the
  firm only represents the borrower in connection with this transaction and may
  have limited knowledge of the borrower's business

### 1.2 Addressees
- [ ] Lender is properly named as addressee
- [ ] In syndicated deals: administrative agent AND each lender addressed
- [ ] Any required co-addressees included (e.g., collateral agent if separate)
- **Severity if missing**: 🔴 CRITICAL — opinion cannot be relied upon by
  parties not addressed

### 1.3 Transaction Identification
- [ ] Transaction accurately described
- [ ] Loan agreement / credit agreement properly identified (date, parties)
- [ ] Purpose of opinion stated (delivered pursuant to Section [X] of the
  loan agreement, or at borrower's request)
- [ ] Date of opinion matches closing date

### 1.4 Client Identification
- [ ] All loan parties for which opinions are being given are identified
  (borrower, each guarantor, each pledgor)
- [ ] Entity types correctly stated (corporation, LLC, LP, trust)
- [ ] Jurisdictions of organization correctly stated
- **Severity if incomplete**: 🔴 CRITICAL — opinions may not cover all
  required loan parties

---

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1 Transaction Documents / Opinion Documents
- [ ] All documents on which opinions are being given are listed
- [ ] Cross-check against the loan agreement's definition of "Loan Documents"
  — are any excluded from the opinion?
- [ ] If a narrower "Opinion Documents" definition is used, assess whether
  the excluded documents matter
- Common exclusions to watch for: UCC financing statements, environmental
  indemnity agreements, subordination agreements, side letters
- **Severity if key docs missing**: 🟡 NEGOTIATE — push for inclusion of
  all material transaction documents

### 2.2 Incorporation by Reference
- [ ] If definitions are incorporated from the loan agreement, confirm
  the incorporation is clear and complete
- [ ] Watch for selective incorporation that may create ambiguity

---

## 3. Documents Reviewed

### 3.1 Transaction Documents
- [ ] All Opinion Documents listed
- [ ] Format stated: signed originals, executed copies, or final drafts
- [ ] If reviewed in draft or unsigned form, a bring-down or confirmation
  that executed versions conform should be included

### 3.2 Organizational Documents
- [ ] Articles/certificate of incorporation or formation reviewed for each
  loan party
- [ ] Bylaws or operating agreement or partnership agreement reviewed
- [ ] Amendments included
- [ ] Certified by secretary/officer or secretary of state

### 3.3 Resolutions and Authorizing Actions
- [ ] Board resolutions or written consents authorizing the transaction
  reviewed for each loan party
- [ ] For LLCs: manager or member approval as required by operating agreement
- [ ] For LPs: general partner approval
- [ ] Incumbency certificates reviewed
- [ ] Secretary's / officer's certificates reviewed

### 3.4 Good Standing / Status Certificates
- [ ] Certificate of good standing (or status) from state of organization
  for each loan party
- [ ] Certificate from each state where foreign qualification opinion given
- [ ] Date of certificates noted — should be within a few days of closing
- [ ] Bring-down certificates for closing date (or date immediately prior)
- **Note**: Florida issues "certificates of status" showing "active" status,
  not "good standing"

### 3.5 Other Documents
- [ ] Opinion backup certificate from borrower (factual certifications)
- [ ] Material contracts schedule (if no-breach opinion given)
- [ ] UCC search results (if security interest opinions given)
- [ ] Other relevant permits, licenses, or approvals

---

## 4. Assumptions

### 4.1 Standard / Implicit Assumptions (Always Acceptable)
These are customary whether stated or unstated:
- Genuineness of all signatures
- Authenticity of all documents submitted as originals
- Conformity to originals of all documents submitted as copies
- Legal capacity of natural persons
- Truthfulness of representations in certificates and records

### 4.2 Enforceability-Related Assumptions (Customary When Stated)
Typically required to support the enforceability opinion:
- Non-client parties are duly organized, validly existing, in good standing
- Non-client parties have power and authority to execute and perform
- Non-client parties have duly authorized, executed, and delivered the
  transaction documents
- Execution/delivery/performance by non-client parties does not violate
  their organizational documents or applicable laws
- Transaction documents constitute legal, valid, binding obligations of
  non-client parties
- Each non-client party has obtained all required consents and approvals
- Adequate consideration has been given for the obligations of each party

### 4.3 Transaction-Specific Assumptions (Must Be Expressly Stated)
Review these carefully for relevance and reasonableness:
- Location of collateral (for UCC opinions)
- Nature and classification of collateral accounts
- Debtor's name matches name on UCC filings
- No changes to organizational documents since date of certificates
- Reliance on local counsel opinions for non-covered jurisdictions
- Borrower's representations in transaction documents are accurate

### 4.4 Red Flags — Assumptions That May Gut Opinions

🔴 **CRITICAL** — Flag any assumption that:

- **Assumes due authorization** when the opinion covers due authorization.
  Example: "We assume all corporate formalities necessary to authorize the
  transaction have been observed." This guts the authorization opinion.

- **Assumes enforceability** of the documents being opined upon. Example:
  "We assume the Transaction Documents are enforceable in accordance with
  their terms." This guts the enforceability opinion entirely.

- **Assumes no violation** when the opinion covers no violation. Example:
  "We assume the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents does
  not violate any law or agreement." This guts the no-violation opinion.

- **Assumes facts the opinion giver should verify**. Example: assuming
  the borrower is duly organized when the opinion giver has the
  organizational documents and good standing certificate to confirm this.

- **Assumes away known risks**. If the opinion giver knows of a material
  fact that contradicts an assumption, the assumption is improper regardless
  of how it is characterized.

### 4.5 Red Flags — Irrelevant Assumptions

🟡 **NEGOTIATE** — Flag assumptions that:

- Relate to transaction types not involved (e.g., securities issuance
  assumptions in a simple bilateral loan)
- Are clearly boilerplate not tailored to the transaction
- Are so numerous they shift the analytical burden to the recipient
- Address matters that the opinion giver could easily verify

### 4.6 Assumptions Regarding Other Counsel
- [ ] If relying on local counsel opinion, that reliance is disclosed
- [ ] If relying on in-house counsel opinion, that reliance is disclosed
- [ ] Scope of reliance is clear (which opinions are based on other counsel)

## 5. Opinions

### 5.1 Expected Opinions — Core (All Loan Transactions)

| Opinion | Expected | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Entity existence / valid existence | ✅ Required | State of organization law; for older entities, "validly existing" is acceptable (avoids researching law at formation) |
| Good standing / active status | ✅ Required | Based on certificate from secretary of state; FL uses "active" not "good standing" |
| Power and authority | ✅ Required | Power to own property, conduct business, enter into transaction |
| Due authorization | ✅ Required | All necessary corporate/LLC/LP action has been taken |
| Due execution and delivery | ✅ Required | Properly executed by authorized persons; delivery established |
| Enforceability | ✅ Required | Legal, valid, binding obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms |
| No violation of organizational documents | ✅ Required | Transaction does not violate charter, bylaws, operating agreement |
| No violation of applicable laws | ✅ Required | Transaction does not violate covered laws |
| No governmental consents required | ✅ Required | No filings or approvals needed under covered laws |

### 5.2 Expected Opinions — Conditional (Transaction-Dependent)

| Opinion | When Expected | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Foreign qualification | When borrower does business in state other than organization state | Active status in each relevant state |
| No violation of material contracts | When lender requires | Limited to scheduled Applicable Contracts; knowledge qualifier acceptable |
| No violation of court orders | When lender requires | Knowledge qualifier required |
| Investment Company Act | Most finance transactions | Certificate from borrower supporting the analysis expected |
| Margin regulations | When pledged equity involved | Federal Reserve Regulations T, U, X |
| UCC security interest creation | Secured transactions | Per TriBar UCC Report |
| UCC perfection by filing | Secured transactions | Proper filing office, correct debtor name |
| UCC perfection by control | Deposit accounts, securities accounts, LOC rights | Method-specific opinions |
| Real property lien validity | Real estate secured loans | Typically from local/special counsel |
| Choice of law | Non-forum law governs documents | "More likely than not" enforced |
| Usury | Florida and other states with usury limits | Rate-specific, calculation method specified |
| Tax opinions | Documentary stamp tax, intangible tax (FL) | Three variants depending on execution location |
| No litigation | Sometimes requested | Increasingly resisted; factual, not legal judgment |
| Lender qualification | Rarely appropriate | Most firms discourage; not customary |

### 5.3 Expected Opinions by Transaction Type

**Bilateral Secured Loan (Real Estate)**:
All Core opinions + Foreign qualification (if applicable) + Enforceability +
No violation of contracts (if lender requires) + UCC security interest +
Real property lien + Choice of law (if non-forum law) + Usury (FL) + Tax (FL)

**Syndicated Secured Loan**:
All of above + Investment Company Act + Margin regulations (if equity pledged)
+ Broad reliance provision for assignees

**Construction Loan**:
All of Bilateral Secured + particular attention to mechanics' lien waivers,
draw procedures, completion guaranty enforceability

**Unsecured Loan**:
Core opinions + Enforceability + No violation + No consents + Investment
Company Act (if applicable)

**Loan Modification / Amendment**:
Opinions on amendment documents + assumption that existing documents are
valid/binding/enforceable + assumption existing security interest
created/attached/perfected. Watch for: opinion giver should opine on
amendment only, not reaffirm underlying document opinions. Consider
novation issues.

### 5.4 Review Points for Each Opinion Given

For each opinion, verify:
- [ ] Covers all loan parties (borrower, each guarantor, each pledgor)
- [ ] Covers all Opinion Documents (not just the loan agreement)
- [ ] Uses accepted formulation (e.g., "legal, valid, and binding obligation,
  enforceable in accordance with its terms" — not deviant language)
- [ ] Subject to appropriate (but not excessive) qualifications
- [ ] Consistent with the related assumptions (no circular reasoning)
- [ ] If knowledge-qualified, the definition of "knowledge" is acceptable

## 6. Qualifications / Exceptions

### 6.1 Standard Qualifications (Always Acceptable)

- **Bankruptcy exception**: Enforceability subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
  reorganization, fraudulent conveyance/transfer, moratorium, or similar
  laws affecting creditors' rights generally. This is universal and expected.

- **Equitable principles**: Enforceability subject to general principles of
  equity, whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity. Also universal.

- **Limited to Applicable Laws / Covered Law**: Opinion addresses only the
  laws specified. This is standard.

- **Reliance on certificates**: Opinion giver relied on certificates from
  officers and public officials for factual matters. Standard.

- **Remedies qualification**: Despite potential unenforceability of specific
  provisions, the core rights (repayment, acceleration, foreclosure,
  realization on collateral) remain enforceable. This is the "golden nugget"
  approach and is expected.

### 6.2 Specific Enforceability Exceptions (Evaluate Each)

These qualify the enforceability opinion for specific types of provisions
in the transaction documents. Each should relate to a provision actually
present in the documents:

| Exception | Customary? | Review Note |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Waivers of broadly or vaguely stated rights | ✅ Yes | Standard |
| Disclaimers of reliance on oral agreements | ✅ Yes | Parol evidence |
| Choice of law / forum selection | ✅ Yes | Subject to constitutional limits |
| Indemnification (may be limited to non-indemnitee fault) | ✅ Yes | Public policy limits |
| Waiver of jury trial | ✅ Yes | May not be binding pre-dispute |
| Consent to jurisdiction / venue / service | ✅ Yes | Constitutional limits |
| Penalty / liquidated damages | ✅ Yes | Must be reasonable estimate |
| Setoff rights | ✅ Yes | Statutory setoff may override |
| Anti-assignment restrictions | ✅ Yes | May be overridden by UCC |
| Waiver of right to raise claims/defenses | ✅ Yes | Policy limitations |
| Usury savings clauses | ✅ Yes | Effectiveness uncertain |
| Fraudulent conveyance savings | ✅ Yes | Upstream/cross-stream guaranties |
| Non-compete / non-solicitation | ✅ Yes | Reasonableness required |
| Specific performance | ✅ Yes | Equitable remedy, not available as of right |
| Best efforts / commercially reasonable efforts | ✅ Yes | Uncertain enforceability |
| Waiver of notice of acceleration | ✅ Yes | Contextual |
| Bail-in provisions | ✅ Yes | For regulated financial institutions |

### 6.3 Red Flags — Qualifications That May Nullify Opinions

🔴 **CRITICAL** — Flag qualifications that:

- Are so broad they effectively withdraw an opinion being given
- Qualify the enforceability opinion with language like "to the extent
  enforceable" (circular)
- Introduce new exceptions beyond customary practice without explanation
- Qualify the authorization or existence opinions (these should not
  be qualified at all, other than reliance on certificates)

🟡 **NEGOTIATE** — Flag qualifications that:

- Include exceptions for provisions not present in the transaction documents
  (boilerplate not tailored)
- Are unusually numerous compared to customary practice
- Qualify the no-violation opinion in ways that narrow it beyond usefulness
- Include "catch-all" language like "and any other provision that may be
  unenforceable" (too vague)

---

## 7. Applicable Laws / Covered Law

### 7.1 Scope Check
- [ ] Covers the governing law of the transaction documents
- [ ] Covers entity statutes of each loan party's jurisdiction of
  organization (corporation law, LLC act, LP act)
- [ ] Covers UCC of the relevant state(s) if secured transaction
- [ ] Covers applicable federal laws (Investment Company Act, margin
  regulations, if opined upon)

### 7.2 Exclusions Check
Standard exclusions are acceptable for laws that require specialized
expertise and are not typically covered by opinion givers in commercial
loan transactions:

Acceptable exclusions: environmental, zoning/land use, labor/ERISA,
utilities/telecom, antitrust, tax, securities (except Investment Company
Act if opined upon), anti-corruption/FCPA, insurance, banking regulation
(except as specifically opined), IP, receivership, CFIUS, CTA/beneficial
ownership, county/municipal ordinances, party-specific regulatory regimes.

🟡 **NEGOTIATE** if the exclusions:
- Remove coverage for statutes directly relevant to opined matters
- Exclude the governing state's entity statutes
- Exclude UCC in a secured transaction
- Are significantly broader than the 2021 report "Laws Commonly Excluded
  from Coverage of Third-Party Legal Opinions in U.S. Commercial Loan
  Transactions" (76 Bus. Law. 889)

---

## 8. Reliance and Disclosure

### 8.1 Bilateral Transactions
- [ ] Lender is sole addressee and reliance party
- [ ] Disclosure to lender's regulators permitted
- [ ] No unnecessary restrictions on internal use

### 8.2 Syndicated Transactions
- [ ] Administrative agent and each lender can rely
- [ ] Reliance by permitted assignees included
- [ ] Wachovia limitation (or equivalent) is acceptable:
  - Opinion speaks only as of date issued
  - No update obligation
  - Assignee has no greater rights than original addressees
  - Reliance must be actual and reasonable at time of assignment
- [ ] Disclosure to prospective assignees permitted
- [ ] Disclosure to regulators permitted

### 8.3 Red Flags on Reliance

🔴 **CRITICAL**:
- No reliance by assignees in a syndicated transaction
- Reliance requires prior written consent of opinion giver (impractical
  for secondary market trading)
- Opinion restricted to a time-limited window (e.g., 10 days after closing)
  without business justification

🟡 **NEGOTIATE**:
- Reliance by assignees but with conditions beyond the Wachovia limitation
- No provision for disclosure to regulators
- Restrictions on disclosure to prospective assignees

---

## 9. Closing Provisions

### 9.1 Customary Practice Interpretation
- [ ] Opinion states it is to be interpreted in accordance with customary
  practice (or the relevant bar report)
- This is standard and acceptable; it means the opinion need not spell
  out every aspect of customary practice

### 9.2 No Implied Opinions
- [ ] Statement that the opinion is limited to matters expressly stated
- [ ] No implied opinions from the opinions given
- This is standard; it reinforces that lender's counsel should not read
  more into the opinion than what is expressly stated

### 9.3 Speaks as of Date
- [ ] Opinion speaks only as of its date
- [ ] No obligation to update for changes in law or fact
- This is standard; if there is a delayed closing, consider whether a
  bring-down or new opinion is needed

### 9.4 Not General Counsel
- [ ] Opinion giver states it is not general counsel to the borrower
  (if applicable)
- This is informational; it means the opinion giver's knowledge of the
  borrower's business may be limited

### 9.5 Limitations on Claims
- [ ] Any limitations on bringing claims (statute of limitations, exclusive
  jurisdiction, agent-only claims) — evaluate whether acceptable
- These are less common in US practice but increasingly proposed

---

## 10. Cross-Cutting Issues

### 10.1 Knowledge Qualifier
Where used (typically for no-litigation, no-violation of orders, and
sometimes no-breach of contracts):
- [ ] "Knowledge" is defined
- [ ] Definition covers the signing partner and lawyers who worked on the
  transaction (the "primary lawyer group")
- [ ] Does not require independent investigation (this is customary)
- [ ] Does not limit to a single individual (too narrow)

### 10.2 Consistency Across Sections
- [ ] Assumptions do not contradict opinions
- [ ] Qualifications do not nullify opinions
- [ ] Covered Law is sufficient for the opinions given
- [ ] Documents reviewed are sufficient to support the opinions

### 10.3 Multiple Opinion Givers
If opinions are delivered by more than one counsel:
- [ ] Together, the opinions cover all required matters
- [ ] No gaps between what one counsel assumes and another opines upon
- [ ] Local counsel opinions are acceptable in form and substance
- [ ] In-house counsel opinions are limited to appropriate matters (typically
  business-knowledge-dependent opinions like Investment Company Act,
  no violation of material contracts, no litigation)

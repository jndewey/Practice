## How to Use

1. Identify the provision in the agreement under review and match it to the applicable section.
2. Compare the language against the Lender's Desired Position, Borrower's Desired Position, and the Market Benchmark.
3. Flag deviations where the agreement is more lender-favorable or borrower-favorable than the benchmark.
4. Generate redline suggestions citing the benchmark as a credible market reference.
5. Note interdependencies between provisions (e.g., budget reallocation affects cost overrun triggers).

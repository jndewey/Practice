# Common Issues in Legal Opinion Review — Red Flags & Negotiation Guidance

This reference synthesizes guidance from the TriBar Opinion Committee, ABA
reports, Practical Law Practice Notes, and customary practice to help
lender's counsel identify and address common issues in borrower's counsel
opinion letters.

---

## I. Assumptions — Common Problems

### A. Assumptions That Gut Opinions

The most serious assumption issue is one that undermines the very opinion
being given. Per the ABA Statement of Opinion Practices (2019) and the
TriBar Report (1998), an assumption must not render an opinion meaningless.

**Examples of Gutting Assumptions:**

1. **Authorization gut**: Opining that the transaction documents have been
   duly authorized, while assuming that "all corporate formalities necessary
   for the transaction documents to be duly authorized have been observed."
   - **Why problematic**: The opinion giver's job is to review the
     resolutions and organizational documents to confirm authorization.
     Assuming the conclusion defeats the purpose.
   - **Response**: Request removal. The opinion giver should review the
     resolutions and organizational documents to support this opinion, not
     assume the result.

2. **Enforceability gut**: Opining that the transaction documents are
   enforceable, while assuming that "each Transaction Document constitutes
   a legal, valid, and binding obligation of each party thereto."
   - **Why problematic**: This is the very opinion being given. Assuming
     it is true for the opinion giver's own client renders the opinion
     circular.
   - **Response**: The assumption is appropriate only as to non-client
     parties. For the opinion giver's client, this is the opinion itself.

3. **Existence gut**: Opining that the borrower is validly existing, while
   assuming that "all filings required to maintain the borrower's existence
   have been made."
   - **Response**: The opinion giver should rely on the good standing
     certificate, not assume the conclusion.

### B. Unreasonable Assumptions

An assumption is unreasonable if the opinion giver knows (or has reason to
know) the assumed fact is false. Per the ABA Guidelines (2002) and TriBar
Report §2.4, opinion givers cannot close their eyes to known facts.

**Watch for:**
- Assumptions about the borrower's business or financial condition that
  conflict with information in the transaction documents
- Assumptions about the absence of litigation when the opinion giver is
  the borrower's litigation counsel
- Assumptions about compliance with laws when the opinion giver has been
  advising on compliance issues

### C. Irrelevant Assumptions

Per the ABA Statement of Opinion Practices §5.5, assumptions should relate
to the transaction and opinions being given. Boilerplate assumptions
transplanted from a different transaction type are problematic because they:

- Shift analytical burden to the opinion recipient
- May obscure genuinely relevant assumptions
- Can protract negotiations unnecessarily
- Signal that the opinion was not carefully tailored

**Common irrelevant assumptions to flag:**
- Securities issuance assumptions in a simple loan transaction
- Cross-border assumptions when all parties are domestic
- Investment fund assumptions for operating company borrowers
- Assumptions about physical delivery of documents when closing was
  electronic

**Response**: Request removal of clearly irrelevant assumptions. The
opinion giver should tailor the opinion to the actual transaction.

### D. Excessive Assumptions About Factual Matters

Some opinion givers include expansive assumptions about factual matters
that the opinion giver could (and should) verify:

- "We assume the borrower's representations in the Transaction Documents
  are true and correct" — This is acceptable for enforceability purposes
  (representations are factual) but should not be used to avoid
  investigating matters the opinion giver should independently confirm.
- "We assume the certificates delivered to us are accurate" — Acceptable
  as a general matter, but if the opinion giver has reason to doubt a
  certificate, the assumption does not cure the problem.

## II. No Litigation Opinion — Detailed Guidance

### A. Why It Is Contested

The no litigation opinion is increasingly resisted because it:

- Is a confirmation of fact, not a legal judgment
- Does not achieve any of the primary objectives of legal opinions
  (informing of legal effect, assuring proper structure, identifying
  legal risks)
- Provides no additional comfort beyond the borrower's own litigation
  representation and warranty in the loan agreement
- The TriBar Report §6.8 states it can be omitted without affecting
  opinion recipients' rights

### B. If the Lender Requires It

If the lender insists on a no litigation opinion, lender's counsel should
expect and accept the following limitations:

1. **Knowledge qualifier**: The opinion will be limited to the opinion
   giver's knowledge. This is defined as the conscious awareness of the
   signing partner and the lawyers who prepared the opinion and worked on
   the transaction (the "primary lawyer group"). No independent
   investigation is required.

2. **Pending only**: The opinion should cover pending litigation. Including
   "threatened" litigation is more difficult because whether something
   constitutes a "threat" is subjective.

3. **Threatened in writing only**: If threatened litigation is included,
   it should be limited to threats made in writing. Oral threats are
   unreliable and open to misinterpretation.

4. **Limited to Opinion Documents**: The opinion should be limited to
   litigation that could affect the validity or enforceability of the
   Opinion Documents, not the borrower generally. This narrows the
   universe of relevant litigation.

5. **Scheduled exceptions**: If the opinion giver knows of litigation
   that could adversely affect the opinion documents, it should be
   listed in a schedule as an exception.

### C. Due Diligence Expected

Per Dean Foods Co. v. Pappathanasi (2004), opinion givers cannot take a
"see no evil, hear no evil" approach. When giving a no litigation opinion,
the opinion giver should have:

- Reviewed the borrower's litigation representations and disclosure
  schedules in the loan documents
- Obtained a certificate from a senior officer as to pending litigation
- Asked lawyers in the firm who may have relevant information
- If on notice of adverse facts, investigated further rather than relying
  on conclusory statements

**Lender's counsel takeaway**: If the no litigation opinion is given with
a knowledge qualifier but no mention of a backup certificate or disclosure
schedule review, consider whether the diligence is adequate.

### D. Acceptable Formulation

The following formulation is generally acceptable:

> "To our knowledge, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry, or
> investigation, at law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental
> Authority, pending or threatened in writing against the Borrower that,
> if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or
> in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the validity or
> enforceability of any Opinion Document."

## III. Reliance by Assignees — Negotiation Framework

### A. Why It Matters

In syndicated transactions, the ability of assignees to rely on the opinion
is critical for secondary market trading. Without it, the loan is harder
to sell because each assignee would need to obtain a new opinion or accept
the risk of having no opinion to rely on.

### B. The Wachovia Limitation (Market Standard)

The widely accepted approach allows reliance subject to four conditions:

1. The opinion speaks only as of its date of issuance
2. The opinion giver has no obligation to update
3. The assignee has no greater rights than the original addressees
4. Reliance must be actual and reasonable under circumstances existing at
   the time of assignment, including changes in law and facts known or
   reasonably knowable by the assignee

This is market standard and should be accepted by lender's counsel.

### C. More Restrictive Approaches (Push Back)

Some opinion givers take more restrictive approaches:

| Approach | Lender's Counsel Response |
|----------|--------------------------|
| No reliance without prior written consent | Unacceptable for syndicated deals — impedes secondary market trading |
| Reliance only within 10-15 business days of closing | Too restrictive — loans trade throughout their term |
| Reliance limited to "financial institutions" | May exclude fund assignees; negotiate broader definition |
| No reliance at all | 🔴 CRITICAL in syndicated deals — requires agent-only reliance at minimum |

### D. Additional Proposals (Evaluate Case-by-Case)

Some opinion givers propose additional limitations:

- **Agent-only claims**: Only the administrative agent can bring claims
  on behalf of lenders. Reduces multiple-jurisdiction litigation risk.
  *Generally acceptable in a syndicated facility.*
- **Specific jurisdiction for claims**: All claims must be brought in a
  specified jurisdiction. Common outside the US (e.g., Netherlands) but
  less common domestically. *Evaluate based on convenience.*
- **Majority lender approval to sue**: Claims require majority lender
  approval. *Reasonable protection against individual vulture fund claims.*
- **Statute of limitations from date of issuance**: Makes clear the clock
  starts running when the opinion is issued. *Arguably the correct rule
  anyway; explicit statement is acceptable.*

## IV. Enforceability Opinion — Key Concerns

### A. Expected Formulation

The enforceability opinion should state that each Transaction Document
"constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation of [Borrower/Guarantor],
enforceable against [Borrower/Guarantor] in accordance with its terms."

**Watch for deviations:**
- Omission of "legal, valid, and binding" — each word has meaning
- "Enforceable" without "in accordance with its terms" — too vague
- Limiting enforceability to "material provisions" — no customary basis
- Adding "assuming the Transaction Documents are enforceable against
  the other parties" — this is acceptable for the opinion giver's
  client but should not be confused with a circular assumption

### B. Required Qualifications

The enforceability opinion is always subject to:

1. **Bankruptcy exception**: Laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
   reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium, and similar laws
   affecting creditors' rights generally

2. **Equitable principles**: General principles of equity, whether
   applied in a proceeding at law or in equity (including concepts of
   materiality, reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing, and the
   possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief)

3. **Remedies qualification**: The "golden nugget" — despite potential
   unenforceability of specific provisions, the Transaction Documents
   contain adequate provisions for the practical realization of the
   principal rights and benefits intended (repayment, acceleration,
   foreclosure, realization on collateral)

### C. The Remedies Qualification — What to Expect

The remedies qualification is the opinion giver's statement that, even
though certain specific provisions may not be enforceable, the core
commercial deal works. Per the TriBar Remedies Opinion Report (2004):

- The opinion giver exercises professional judgment about which specific
  provisions may be unenforceable
- The opinion giver then assesses whether, despite those issues, the
  lender's fundamental rights are preserved
- The "golden nugget" approach means the opinion giver is saying: "You
  get the core deal even if you lose some peripheral provisions"

**Red flags in the remedies qualification:**
- Failure to specify the core rights preserved (repayment, acceleration,
  foreclosure should always be mentioned)
- Hedging language like "substantially all" or "most" of the benefits
- Carving out the guaranty from the remedies qualification (guaranty
  enforceability is critical to the lender)

## V. Covered Law / Applicable Laws — Scope Issues

### A. Expected Coverage

The Applicable Laws definition should cover laws that a lawyer in the
relevant jurisdiction exercising customary professional diligence would
recognize as applicable to the transaction. This typically includes:

- State law of the governing jurisdiction (e.g., Florida, New York)
- Entity statutes of each loan party's state of organization
- UCC of the relevant state(s) for secured transactions
- Federal laws normally applicable to finance transactions
- Specific statutes for specific opinions (e.g., usury statutes if
  usury opinion given, Investment Company Act if that opinion given)

### B. Acceptable Exclusions

The 2021 report on "Laws Commonly Excluded from Coverage" (76 Bus.
Law. 889) provides the market standard for exclusions. Exclusions for
specialized regulatory regimes are expected and should not be contested:

Environmental, ERISA/labor, zoning/land use, utilities/telecom, antitrust,
tax, securities (except as specifically opined), anti-corruption/FCPA,
insurance regulation, banking regulation (except as specifically opined),
intellectual property, receivership, CFIUS, CTA/beneficial ownership,
county/municipal ordinances, party-specific regulatory regimes.

### C. Problematic Exclusions

🟡 **NEGOTIATE** if the opinion excludes:
- The governing state's general contract law
- The entity statutes of a loan party's state of organization
- UCC Article 9 when the transaction is secured
- Federal bankruptcy law (this is different from the bankruptcy
  exception to enforceability — the opinion should still be informed
  by bankruptcy concepts)
- Usury laws when a usury opinion is expected but not given

## VI. Florida-Specific Issues for Lender's Counsel

See `references/florida-lender-guide.md` for detailed Florida guidance.
Key points for quick reference:

- Florida issues "certificates of status" (not "good standing"); entity
  should be shown as "active"
- Usury: 18% simple interest for loans ≤$500K; 25% for loans >$500K;
  365-day year, actual days elapsed
- Choice of law: "more likely than not" standard per Continental Mortgage
  Investors v. Sailboat Key (1981) — requires "normal and reasonable
  relationship" to chosen jurisdiction
- Documentary stamp tax and nonrecurring intangible tax: failure to pay
  renders document unenforceable until paid but does NOT affect lien
  validity or constructive notice
- Florida Revised LLC Act (Ch. 605) effective Jan. 1, 2014 — confirm
  opinion cites current statute

## VII. Negotiation Strategy — General Principles

### A. Pick Your Battles

Not every departure from ideal practice warrants a comment. Focus on:
1. Issues that affect the lender's ability to enforce the loan documents
2. Missing opinions required by the conditions precedent
3. Assumptions that gut opinions
4. Qualifications that nullify opinions
5. Reliance provisions inadequate for the transaction structure

### B. Cite Authority

When requesting changes, cite specific authority:
- TriBar Report section numbers
- ABA Statement of Opinion Practices provisions
- Relevant state bar reports
- Specific case law (Dean Foods for no-litigation diligence)
This demonstrates the request is based on customary practice, not
arbitrary preference.

### C. Propose Solutions

Rather than simply objecting, propose specific alternative language.
This accelerates negotiations and demonstrates good faith.

### D. Escalation Path

1. Initial comments to borrower's counsel (professional, specific)
2. If unresolved, involve senior partners on both sides
3. If still unresolved, discuss with client whether the issue is a
   closing condition or a business point to negotiate
4. Document any accepted deviations from customary practice for the file

### E. Timing

- Request the form of opinion early (with the commitment letter or
  at loan agreement drafting stage)
- Review draft opinions promptly — do not wait until the closing date
- Allow adequate time for borrower's counsel to address comments
- Do not allow opinion negotiations to become the reason a deal
  doesn't close on time

---

## VIII. Documentation of Review

### A. Internal Memorandum

Lender's counsel should prepare an internal memorandum documenting:
- Each opinion reviewed (who gave it, what it covers)
- Any deviations from customary practice identified
- The resolution of each issue (accepted, modified, waived)
- Residual risks the lender should be aware of
- Recommendation to the lender (acceptable to fund or not)

### B. Client Communication

When explaining the opinion to the lender client:
- Summarize what the opinion covers and what it does not
- Explain the significance of key qualifications (especially the
  bankruptcy exception and remedies qualification)
- Note any opinions that were requested but not given
- Identify residual risks the lender is accepting
- Confirm that taken together with any local counsel or in-house
  opinions, the closing condition has been satisfied

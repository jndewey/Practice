## 1. Overview and Structure

The Pledge and Security Agreement is the operative security document for a mezzanine loan — the analog of a mortgage in real property lending. Unlike a mortgage (created, perfected, and enforced under state real property law), the pledge is created, perfected, and enforced under the UCC as adopted by the governing jurisdiction.

This document assumes a Delaware LLC structure, which is the market standard because of Delaware's well-established corporate law. The pledgor (mezzanine borrower) and the mortgage borrower are typically both Delaware LLCs, though they may be formed under any state's laws.

## 2. Preamble and Recitals

The preamble identifies the pledgor (mezzanine borrower) and the lender (mezzanine lender), establishes the effective date (typically the loan closing date), and references the mezzanine loan agreement and promissory note.

**Recitals** function to:
- Give basic background about the parties and transaction structure
- Recite consideration
- Establish that the pledgor is the sole member of the mortgage borrower, owning 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests
- State that the pledge is a condition precedent to making the loan

**Drafting tip**: If the lender is relying on specific facts stated in the recitals, incorporate the recitals by specific reference into the operative provisions. Do not include binding obligations in recitals — those belong in the operative sections.

## 3. Key Defined Terms

### Article 8 Matters
Any action affecting the designation of the pledged interests as "securities" under UCC Article 8. The lender requires exclusive voting authority over Article 8 Matters to prevent the pledgor from revoking the opt-in.

### Certificate of Membership
The physical certificate representing the pledged interests, together with an undated stock power indorsed in blank. Ensure the definition includes the indorsement and all replacements/substitutions.

### Collateral
Broadly defined to include: all pledged membership interests, all certificates or instruments evidencing them, all income/dividends/distributions (including return of capital), all "accounts" (UCC definition, much broader than common usage), all "general intangibles" (includes IP, contract rights, payment intangibles), all investment property, all supporting obligations, and all proceeds.

### Confirmation Statement (or Control Agreement)
For **certificated** interests: The mortgage borrower's written acknowledgment of the pledge, agreement to register it on company books, acknowledgment of the irrevocable proxy, and agreement to follow lender's instructions post-default.

For **uncertificated** interests: A control agreement from the mortgage borrower agreeing to follow lender's instructions without further pledgor consent.

### Pledged Interests
100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the mortgage borrower (the sole asset the pledgor owns). CMBS loans and rating agencies expect a 100% pledge with no minority interests left unpledged.

### Secured Obligations
All obligations under the mezzanine loan documents — principal, interest, fees, expenses, indemnities, and all other amounts. Should cross-reference the loan agreement's definition.

## 4. Grant of Security Interest

### The Granting Clause

The granting clause must describe with specificity the collateral securing the pledged obligations. The pledgor makes an **absolute, irrevocable, unconditional** pledge of:
- All Pledged Interests
- All certificates/instruments evidencing the interests
- All income, dividends, distributions (cash or in-kind), including return of capital
- All "accounts" (UCC §9-102(2) definition)
- All "general intangibles" (UCC §9-102(42) definition)
- All investment property
- All supporting obligations
- All proceeds of any of the foregoing

### Absolute vs. Collateral Pledge

Like an assignment of leases and rents in a mortgage transaction, the pledgor makes an **absolute** pledge. The lender grants a revocable license back to the pledgor to exercise rights in the collateral (with exceptions). The license is automatically revoked on default.

### Attachment

For the security interest to attach under UCC §9-203, three conditions must be satisfied:
1. The pledgor must have rights in the collateral
2. Value must be given by the secured party (the loan proceeds)
3. The pledgor must authenticate the security agreement (execute the pledge)

---

## 5. Delivery and Perfection

### Delivery Obligations

At closing, the pledgor must deliver:
- The original Certificate of Membership with undated stock power indorsed in blank
- If certificated: The certificate for delivery to the lender
- If uncertificated: The control agreement from the mortgage borrower
- Executed irrevocable proxy agreement
- Confirmation statement / acknowledgment from the mortgage borrower
- Evidence that the pledge has been registered on the mortgage borrower's books

### Perfection Methods

| Method | Priority Level | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Filing (UCC-1) | Lowest | File in pledgor's state of organization |
| Possession | Higher | Physical delivery of certificated security |
| Control | Highest | Article 8 opt-in + delivery (certificated) or control agreement (uncertificated) |

**Best practice**: Perfect by both filing AND control. The UCC-1 filing provides backup perfection; control provides the highest lien priority (protected purchaser status).

### UCC Insurance

Mezzanine lenders routinely require the borrower to purchase a UCC insurance policy insuring the lender's lien on the pledged collateral. Additionally, mezzanine lenders require a mezzanine financing endorsement to the mortgage borrower's fee title policy, giving the mezzanine lender the right to receive title policy proceeds (up to the mezzanine loan amount) before the policy pays the mortgage borrower.

## 6. Representations and Warranties

The pledgor represents and warrants about three categories:

### Corporate Existence and Identity
- Valid formation, good standing, authority to execute
- Organizational documents are complete and current
- No conflicts with organizational documents or applicable law

### Mortgage Borrower (Pledged Entity)
- Valid formation, good standing of the mortgage borrower
- Organizational documents permit the pledge
- No consents required (or all consents obtained)

### Mezzanine Loan Collateral
- Pledgor owns 100% of issued and outstanding interests
- No liens or claims on the pledged interests (except the mezzanine lender's)
- UCC financing statements are accurate
- Article 8 designation is in effect
- The interests are freely transferable

**Scope of due diligence**: Because mezzanine lenders succeed to the pledgor's position on foreclosure (including personal contract obligations), mezzanine lender due diligence is more analogous to a property purchaser than a mortgagee. The pledgor is not ordinarily required to represent about contracts and leases exclusively affecting the mortgage property (since the pledgor doesn't directly own the property and those items are covered under the mortgage loan).

---

## 7. Covenants

Key ongoing covenants of the pledgor:

- Maintain the Article 8 designation; do not revoke the opt-in
- Do not create or permit additional liens on the collateral
- Do not sell, transfer, or encumber the pledged interests without lender consent
- Do not amend the mortgage borrower's organizational documents without consent
- Do not permit the mortgage borrower to issue additional membership interests
- Maintain books and records; provide lender access
- Deliver all notices received from the mortgage lender
- Comply with all UCC requirements to maintain perfection
- Promptly notify lender of any adverse claims to the collateral
- Do not change the pledgor's state of organization without prior notice and lender consent (affects UCC filing jurisdiction)

---

## 8. Voting Rights and Control

### Irrevocable Proxy

The pledge agreement typically grants the lender an irrevocable proxy to vote the pledged interests on specific matters, most critically:
- Any change to the Article 8 designation
- Bankruptcy filings
- Dissolution or winding up of the mortgage borrower
- Material amendments to organizational documents

A separate Irrevocable Proxy Agreement is usually delivered alongside the pledge agreement.

### Pre-Default vs. Post-Default Rights

**Before default**: The pledgor retains the license to exercise most voting and management rights, subject to the restrictive covenants. The lender holds exclusive authority over Article 8 Matters at all times.

**After default**: The license is revoked. The lender may exercise all voting rights, attend meetings, and direct the management of the mortgage borrower. However, the lender must be cautious not to participate in day-to-day operations to avoid **lender liability** — particularly CERCLA environmental liability if found to be in control of the mortgage borrower's property operations.

---

## 9. Default and Remedies

### Events of Default

Cross-referenced to the mezzanine loan agreement. Typically includes: payment defaults, covenant breaches, misrepresentations, bankruptcy events, cross-defaults to the mortgage loan, and failure to maintain collateral.

### Available Remedies

On default, the lender may:
- Accelerate the mezzanine loan
- Foreclose the pledge (via UCC Article 9 — private sale, public sale, or strict foreclosure)
- Exercise all voting and control rights over the pledged interests
- Collect all distributions and income from the mortgage borrower
- Exercise the irrevocable proxy
- Pursue any other rights under the UCC or applicable law

### Important: No Obligation to Prove Impairment

The pledge agreement should provide that the lender has no obligation to allege, show, or prove any impairment to its security in order to pursue legal and equitable remedies.

## 10. Borrower-Side Negotiation Points

When representing the mezzanine borrower/pledgor:

- **Limit the absolute pledge**: Negotiate for a collateral (not absolute) assignment, or at minimum ensure the license-back provision is robust and clearly defined.
- **Restrict post-default control**: Require the lender to provide notice and opportunity to cure before exercising control rights.
- **Protect against lender liability exposure**: Include indemnification provisions running from lender to borrower for actions taken while exercising control.
- **Guarantor release**: Insist on release of guarantors and indemnitors upon foreclosure or permitted transfer.
- **Limit proxy scope**: Narrow the irrevocable proxy to specific enumerated matters rather than a blanket grant.
- **Organizational document amendments**: Negotiate for reasonable consent (not sole discretion) for non-material amendments.
- **State of organization changes**: Ensure adequate time to comply with re-filing requirements.

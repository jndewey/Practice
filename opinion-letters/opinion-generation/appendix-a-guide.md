- Commodity accounts → control (via commodity account control agreement)

- Address appointment of agent for service of process

**Outbound Cross-Border Opinions** (opinions given to foreign entities on US law):

  practice

- H&K strongly discourages "as if" enforceability opinions

3. No required Delaware governmental consents
4. Limited partner liability protection (with statutory exceptions)
5. No provisions causing limited partners to control business under §17-303

7. Investment Company Act exemption
8. Valid issuance of limited partnership interests

**H&K Policy Note:** H&K does not give general enforceability opinions on Delaware-
law-governed documents (other than entity housekeeping and UCC) because it is not
sufficiently familiar with Delaware contract law to give Delaware enforceability
opinions.

## Addendum VIII: Amendments

**Key Assumptions:**
- Existing Documents constitute valid, binding, and enforceable obligations
- All conditions precedent to amendment effectiveness have been satisfied/waived
- Existing security interest was created, attached, and perfected

**H&K Preference:** Enforceability and other opinions should pertain solely to the
Amendment Documents. If opposing counsel insists, it is permissible to opine on
"the Amendment Documents and the Existing Documents, as amended."

**Key Qualifications:**
- Opinions limited to Amendment Documents themselves — no opinion on validity of
  underlying agreements
- No opinion on whether amendments novate existing documents
- Consider whether amendment expressly provides it is not a novation

## Addendum IX: Choice of Law / Governing Law

**Assumption When Opining on Agreement Governed by Non-Opinion Jurisdiction:**
Assume the agreement is governed by the opinion jurisdiction's law and that a
court would give effect to that choice.

**"As If" Enforceability Opinion:**
"If [State] law were the law that purported to govern the Transaction Documents
(and we note that the Transaction Documents provide that they are governed by the
laws of _______), each Transaction Document would be such Relevant Party's valid
and binding obligation..."

**Delaware-Governed Documents:**
H&K does not give Delaware law enforceability opinions (except entity housekeeping
and UCC). Use assumption: "To the extent that any laws other than [entity statute]
or the Applicable Laws of [State] govern, we have assumed the Transaction Documents
are governed by the laws of [State], without giving effect to choice of law
provisions."

**Split Choice of Law (Mortgages):**
Three variants depending on whether opining on local law, NY law, or both.
Express no opinion on which provisions a court would hold are governed by which
jurisdiction's law.

## Addendum X: Local Counsel Opinions

- Use the main H&K form as starting point, adapted for local counsel scope
- Include only opinions within local counsel's jurisdiction
- Add assumption: forms executed at closing match forms furnished

- Choice of law opinions from Addendum IX

# CRE Loan Entity Due Diligence — Lender's Counsel

A reference skill for conducting and reviewing borrower-party entity due diligence in commercial real estate loan transactions.

---

## 1. Pre-Diligence: Review Loan Terms First

Before beginning entity review, examine the **term sheet or commitment letter** for organizational requirements imposed on borrower parties. Identify:

- Whether SPE status is required (standard for most CRE loans).
- Whether bankruptcy remoteness is required (typical for loans > $25M).
- Any deal-specific governance restrictions (e.g., distribution limitations — temporary, permanent, or contingent).
- Whether the loan is originated for securitization (triggers rating agency requirements).
- Whether any equity owners are non-US entities (triggers CTA analysis).

---

## 2. Single Purpose Entity (SPE) Requirements

Most CRE loans require the borrower to be an SPE. Securitized loans also require the entity *controlling* the borrower to be an SPE.

### Core SPE Characteristics
- **Sole purpose**: Borrower SPE exists only to own and operate the collateral property. Owner SPE exists only to own and manage the borrower.
- **Newly formed**: Recycled entities generally cannot satisfy SPE requirements due to continuing-liability risk. Exception is rare and requires proof of no continuing obligations.
- **Separateness covenants**: Org docs must contain lender-approved affirmative and negative covenants governing how the SPE conducts business, keeping it independent from affiliated entities.

### Why SPE Matters
SPE structure insulates the lender from: insolvency of related parties, substantive consolidation risk, and competing creditor claims.

### Entity Type
Borrowers are typically formed as **LLCs** to maximize nonrecourse liability protection.

---

## 3. Bankruptcy Remote Requirements

Required for large loans (typically > $25M). Adds structural protections beyond basic SPE status.

### Key Elements
- At least one **independent director/manager/GP** who is not affiliated with the borrower.
- Voluntary bankruptcy filing requires **consent of the independent party**.
- Lender receives limited control rights over the independent party:
  - Input/consent on appointment, removal, and qualification criteria.
  - Consent rights for equity transfers.
  - Third-party beneficiary enforcement rights for bankruptcy-remote provisions.

### Limitation
Bankruptcy law prohibits lender from having a *direct* vote on the borrower's voluntary filing — control is exerted indirectly through the independent-party mechanism.

---

## 4. Corporate Transparency Act (CTA)

If any equity owners of borrower parties are **non-US entities**, both lender's and borrower's counsel must confirm CTA compliance (31 U.S.C. § 5336). The CTA requires non-US entities to report beneficial ownership information to FinCEN. Some states have enacted parallel state-level reporting requirements.

> **Note**: FinCEN has issued an interim final rule exempting domestic companies. Monitor for the final rule and check the CTA Rules and Publications Tracker for current status.

---

## 5. Entity Structure — Review All Levels

All levels of the borrower's organizational chain must be examined. Example: if the borrower is a Delaware LLC whose managing member is a Delaware corporation, review:

- The borrower LLC's organizational documents.
- The managing-member corporation's organizational documents.

---

## 6. Organizational Document Checklist by Entity Type

### LLCs (most common borrower type)
- Operating agreement (a/k/a limited liability company agreement) and amendments
- Articles of organization / articles of formation / certificate of formation (state-filed)
- Certificate of good standing
- Resolutions and consents required under the LLC agreement

### Corporations
- Bylaws and amendments
- Shareholder agreements (if any)
- Certificate of incorporation (state-filed) and amendments
- Certificate of good standing
- Corporate resolutions and consents

### Partnerships (General or Limited)
- Partnership agreement
- Certificate of formation (state-filed)
- Evidence of existence or subsistence (if available in the jurisdiction)
- Resolutions and consents required under the partnership agreement

### Joint Ventures
- Joint venture agreement
- Organizational documents of each non-individual JV partner

**Critical JV Review Point**: Pay particular attention to provisions that allow a JV partner to **remove the sponsor or other controlling party from management** of the borrower (e.g., removal-for-cause triggers, key-person defaults, deadlock remedies, buy-sell mechanics). These provisions must be reviewed **in connection with the loan documents' change-of-control and transfer restrictions**, as a management removal under the JV agreement could constitute a prohibited transfer or change of control under the loan, triggering a default or acceleration. Ensure the loan documents and JV agreement are harmonized on this point.

---

## 7. Formation Verification

### What to Confirm
- Entity properly filed its formation certificate with the selected state.
- Obtain a **state-certified, dated copy** of the filed formation certificate and all amendments.
- Issuing authority is typically the Secretary of State.

### Formation Certificate Contents (publicly filed)
- Entity's legal name
- Business purpose
- Proposed duration (may be perpetual)
- Person or proxy forming the entity
- Designated agent for service of process

### Date of Formation
The date on the state-certified certificate is the entity's recognized date of existence. For SPE compliance, confirm the entity is **newly formed** (not recycled).

---

## 8. Good Standing

### Requirement
Entity must be in good standing in its state of formation. Some lenders also require good standing in the state where the mortgaged property is located.

### How to Confirm
Obtain a **certified, dated good standing certificate** from the formation jurisdiction confirming compliance with all filings and fees.

### Staleness Rule
Good standing certificates are **date-sensitive**. Lenders typically require reordering if the certificate is **more than 30 days old** before closing. Title companies, opinion counsel, and lender's counsel independently confirm good standing on the closing day.

---

## 9. Foreign Qualification

If the borrower (or property manager) owns, operates, or manages collateral **outside its state of formation**, it must qualify to transact business in each state where collateral is located.

### How to Confirm
Obtain a **certified, date-stamped certificate** from the foreign jurisdiction confirming the entity's qualification. These certificates are date-sensitive (same staleness considerations as good standing certificates).

---

## 10. Power and Authority

### Org Doc Requirements
The borrower's organizational documents must:
- Grant authority to enter into the loan transaction.
- Authorize performance of the loan obligations.
- Delegate signing authority to one or more authorized officers.

### Scope Variations
- Some lenders require org docs to **reference the specific loan**.
- Others permit a **general authorization** to incur mortgage debt.

### Third-Party Consent Check
Confirm the borrower's powers are not limited or conditioned on third-party consent. If they are, verify that all limitations have been lifted and all required consents obtained.

---

## 11. Closing Deliverables

### Secretary's Certificate (Omnibus)
At closing, the borrower must deliver a sworn certification that:
- Formation documents of each entity are **true and complete**.
- The loan transaction has been **properly authorized** by each entity (with resolutions reflecting all required actions taken and consents obtained, especially for unanimous/supermajority requirements).
- The person signing loan documents is **authorized to do so**.

### Borrower's Counsel Obligations
- Submit all org docs to title company and lender's counsel **before closing**.
- Attach copies of org docs to the secretary's certificate.

### Deal-Specific Closing Items
If the term sheet contains deal-specific governance requirements:
- Address them in the closing certificate.
- Add corresponding **specific default provisions** in the loan documents.

---

## 12. Responsible Parties Reminder

Entity due diligence is not solely the lender's responsibility. It also falls on **any loan counsel rendering an opinion** on:
- Formation, existence, good standing, or corporate authority of any loan party.
- Parties' compliance with applicable laws.

Additionally, the **USA PATRIOT Act** requires financial institutions to verify borrower/guarantor identity and screen against prohibited-persons lists.

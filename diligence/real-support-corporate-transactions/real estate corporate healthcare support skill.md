# Real Estate Support Skill: Large Healthcare Corporate Transactions

## Purpose and Scope

This skill provides guidance for a real estate specialist supporting large healthcare corporate transactions, including asset acquisitions, stock purchases, and mergers. Real estate counsel handles legal issues involving owned or leased real estate concurrently with the negotiation of other transaction issues. The materiality of the real estate assets to the corporate transaction dictates the scope of the real estate counsel's role, whether an asset purchase or a stock purchase or merger.

Real estate counsel's role in a corporate transaction involves three key areas: (1) due diligence and risk assessment, (2) negotiation of transaction agreements, and (3) closing contingencies and deliveries.

---

## Phase 1: Transaction Structuring and Initial Assessment

### Understanding the Transaction Structure

Before beginning any work, real estate counsel must understand the basic structure of the overall transaction. Key structural questions include:

- **Asset Acquisition:** Confirm that the seller entity is the landlord under the leases and that title to the property is currently vested in the seller entity listed in the asset purchase agreement.
- **Stock Purchase or Merger:** Confirm whether there will be a change of control, which is relevant for landlord consent issues in leases and transfer tax analysis. Determine if the transaction is a forward merger, reverse merger, forward triangular merger, or reverse triangular merger—each structure has a different impact on the diligence process and required deliveries for both owned and leased property.
- **Entity-Level Considerations:** If the target company is a subsidiary of a larger parent company, title to the real property may be held by the parent company; the acquisition of stock does not automatically transfer rights to the real property. Leases may need to be assigned or title transferred to the target company before closing.

### Critical Initial Information Gathering

Real estate counsel should gather the following background information at the outset:

| Category | Information Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| Property Count | Number of owned and leased property sites |
| Location & Size | Address, acreage (owned), square footage (leased) |
| Property Use | Healthcare facility type (hospital, clinic, surgical center, administrative) |
| Unusual Features | Environmental concerns, zoning issues, federal water rights, industrial revenue bonds |
| Other Interests | Options to purchase/lease, license or franchise agreements permitting use of real property |
| Construction Status | Nature, stage of completion, amounts expended |
| Transitional Use | Whether parties need to arrange for transitional or permanent use of certain real property |

### Healthcare-Specific Considerations

For healthcare transactions, real estate counsel should pay particular attention to:

- **Permitted Uses Under Leases:** Confirm that current healthcare uses are permitted under lease terms.
- **Regulatory Permits and Licenses:** Coordinate with healthcare regulatory counsel regarding permits, licenses, and governmental approvals required to use the real property or operate the healthcare business.
- **Zoning and Land Use Compliance:** Healthcare facilities often have specific zoning requirements.
- **Environmental Reports:** The lender will likely require Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Reports for owned property and, depending on results, may require Phase II reports.

### Timing and Lead-Time Items

Many real estate matters require significant lead time. Real estate counsel must advise the corporate attorney and client on time estimates for:

- Delivery of surveys and title searches (title commitment or title abstract)
- Reviewing and clearing title exceptions and survey defects
- Obtaining estoppel certificates from applicable parties
- Negotiating non-disturbance agreements for material leased property
- Obtaining landlord lien waivers and consents

### Financing Considerations

Real estate counsel must determine early whether the transaction involves acquisition financing and whether the financing will be secured by real property. Key financing inquiries include:

- Whether existing mortgages encumber the seller's or target company's assets and must be satisfied and released
- Whether existing mortgages require the mortgage lender's consent for change in control
- Whether mortgage recording taxes will be imposed in each jurisdiction
- Whether existing mortgages can be assigned rather than discharged to achieve significant savings in mortgage recording taxes

---

## Phase 2: Due Diligence

### Due Diligence Documents

Real estate counsel should provide the corporate attorney with a comprehensive due diligence request list tailored to the transaction. Key documents include:

**For Owned Property:**
- Existing title insurance policies
- Existing surveys
- Vesting deeds
- Appraisals
- Environmental reports (Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Reports)
- Recent real estate tax bills
- Tenant leases

**For Leased Property:**
- Leases and all amendments, extensions, renewals, and lease guaranties
- Written summary of basic terms of any oral leases
- Existing title insurance policies and surveys (if leased property is material enough to require leasehold title insurance)

### Title and Survey Review

Title and survey matters are some of the longer lead time items involved in acquiring real estate.

**Title Company Selection:** Real estate counsel should select a title company with whom they have a good working relationship, that can provide the required coverage, and that has offices in all jurisdictions where the real property is located.

**Title Insurance Requirements:**

| Transaction Type | Title Insurance Considerations |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Asset Acquisition | More likely to require title insurance because owned property must be transferred by deed |
| Stock Purchase/Merger | Seller more likely to require purchaser to accept title "as is"; non-imputation endorsement should be requested |
| Leased Property | Obtain leasehold title insurance policy for material leased property |

**Non-Imputation Endorsement:** For stock purchases and mergers, real estate counsel should request a non-imputation endorsement, which ensures that the title company cannot deny coverage based on any person's knowledge that otherwise would be imputed to the insured entity.

**Survey Requirements:** Surveys should conform to ALTA/NSPS Land Title Survey minimum detail requirements and include other standards required by the title company, the purchaser, or the lender.

### Lease Review

Real estate counsel should review each lease in which the seller or target company holds an interest as tenant or landlord. The lease review chart should capture:

- Names of landlord and tenant parties
- Lease documents reviewed and missing documents
- Location, size, and use of the leased property
- Assignment provisions and change of control clauses
- Whether landlord consent is required for the transaction
- Unusual provisions (non-market terms, termination options, purchase options)
- Recapture rights and profit-sharing rights
- Rent, security deposit, additional rent obligations

### Landlord Consent Analysis

**Asset Acquisitions:** Leases typically require the landlord's consent for an assignment. However, there may be exceptions where consent is not required, such as if the tenant entity is assigning the lease as part of the sale of all or substantially all its assets.

**Stock Purchases/Mergers:** Landlord consent may not be required unless the transaction triggers a change of control of the tenant entity and the change of control is deemed an assignment under the lease. Key considerations:

- Definition of change of control in the lease (may be found outside assignment/subletting provisions)
- Whether assignment by operation of law requires consent (for mergers)
- Whether a forward triangular merger (where target does not survive) versus reverse triangular merger (where target survives) requires consent

**If Consent Is Required, note:**
- Time periods in the lease for obtaining consent
- Required deliverables (financial statements, copies of assignment instruments)
- Financial covenants that must be satisfied
- Requirements for a qualified replacement lease guarantor
- Any fees payable to the landlord

### Related Party Leases

It is common for the seller or target company to lease property from a related party. Real estate counsel should determine whether such leases contain arm's-length terms or unusual tenant obligations (e.g., rent not at market rate, obligation to rebuild after casualty under short-term lease).

### Estoppel Certificates

For material leased property important to the transaction or operation of the business, real estate counsel should consider requesting estoppel certificates as a due diligence item and closing condition. An estoppel certificate is a certification by the landlord or tenant of material lease terms, including whether there are any current defaults.

---

## Phase 3: Purchase Agreement Negotiations

### General Approach

Real estate counsel should review the acquisition agreement and confirm general contract terms that impact real estate provisions:

- Whether representations and warranties survive and for how long
- What indemnification the seller provides for breaches of representations and warranties

The goal should be to provide the minimum amount of mark-up necessary to achieve adequate client protections and risk mitigation.

### Description of Real Property

Owned real property should be identified on a schedule by property address and legal description. Leased real property should be identified on a schedule including property address and a list of all leases, amendments, extensions, renewals, and related documents.

### Representations and Warranties

Real estate counsel should first review general representations to determine if they already cover real estate issues:

- A general litigation representation can cover issues of condemnation
- A compliance with laws representation can cover zoning, permits, and other real estate-specific laws
- A non-contravention or no conflicts representation can cover landlord consents

**For Owned Property, negotiate representations stating:**
- Good and marketable indefeasible fee simple title, free and clear of all liens except permitted liens
- No grants to others of the right to use the real property (other than as disclosed)
- No outstanding options or rights of first offer/refusal to purchase

**For Leased Property, negotiate representations stating:**
- Each lease is legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect
- Neither the seller/target nor any other party is in breach or default
- No subleases, licenses, or other grants of rights to use or occupy
- No collateral assignment or security interest in any lease

**Additional Representations (if real estate is critical to the transaction):**
- Compliance with zoning and other real property laws
- Condemnation
- Permits, licenses, and governmental approvals required to use property or operate business
- Mechanic's liens (if significant construction in progress or recently completed)
- Access to the real property
- Availability of utility services
- General condition of improvements
- Insurability of the real property

### Permitted Liens and Encumbrances

Real estate counsel should pay careful attention to the definition of permitted liens and encumbrances. Do not accept as permitted encumbrances any matters that materially impair:

- The use or occupancy of the real property
- The operation of the business conducted at the property
- The value of the real property

### Covenants

The acquisition agreement should include pre-closing covenants obligating the seller or target company to:

- Maintain the real property in the same condition as on the date of the acquisition agreement (subject to ordinary wear and tear)
- Refrain from selling or encumbering owned real property without purchaser consent
- Refrain from amending, modifying, renewing, or terminating leases, or entering into new leases, without purchaser consent
- Use best efforts to assist in obtaining title commitments, title insurance policies, and surveys
- Remove from title any liens or encumbrances that are not permitted
- Provide access to the real property for inspections and tests

### Closing Conditions and Deliveries

Real estate counsel should require the following as closing conditions, as applicable:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Title Insurance Policies | Together with seller's indemnity/affidavit, payoff letters from existing lenders |
| Surveys | Conforming to ALTA/NSPS requirements |
| Transfer Tax Returns | Requisite returns accompanying conveyance instruments |
| Landlord Consents | For assignments of leases, waiver of landlord liens, collateral assignment of lease |
| Estoppel Certificates | From landlord or tenant, as applicable |
| Non-Disturbance Agreements (SNDAs) | From each lender encumbering material leased property |
| FIRPTA Certificate | From seller or target company |
| Deeds (Asset Acquisition) | For each parcel of owned real property |
| Assignment and Assumption of Leases (Asset Acquisition) | For leased real property |

**Change in Condition:** Negotiate a closing condition that the real property undergo no damage or destruction and no changes that would have a material adverse effect on use, occupancy, or operation of the business.

---

## Phase 4: Finance Document Review

### Credit Agreement

Real estate counsel should familiarize themselves with the basic structure of the credit transaction and pay particular attention to the title insurance and other real estate closing conditions for funding the loan.

### Mortgages and Deeds of Trust

Key principles for mortgage review:

- The mortgage should be a security instrument only and should not expand the borrower's obligations beyond those in the credit agreement
- The mortgage should be consistent with the terms and obligations under the credit agreement
- If the mortgage contains a UCC-9 security interest in personal property and there is a separate security agreement, negotiate to delete this provision from the mortgage (to avoid confusion if the financing statement is released under the security agreement but not the mortgage)
- For leasehold mortgages, the mortgage should not impose covenants or conditions that conflict with the borrower's obligations as tenant under the lease

### Lender Requirements

Real estate counsel should request the lender's counsel to provide requirements regarding:

- Title insurance, endorsements, and surveys
- Mortgages or deeds of trust and fixture filings
- Local counsel enforceability opinions
- Landlord lien waiver and consent agreements
- Estoppel certificates

### Landlord Lien Waivers

If the lender requires a landlord lien waiver and consent agreement, it is usually most efficient to have the landlord or its counsel and the lender's counsel resolve issues directly. Real estate counsel should stay informed of any issues that may prevent the lender from closing.

---

## Phase 5: Pre-Closing and Closing

### Closing Checklist

Use the closing conditions section of the acquisition agreement to create a real estate closing checklist. If there are multiple properties, organize the checklist by property address and list the deliverables for each property site.

For each deliverable, track:

- The party responsible for preparing and drafting the deliverable
- Important dates or timelines
- The date comments were last given or received or if the form is final
- Whether the deliverable has been executed and delivered (for third-party items)
- Supplemental items that must accompany the deliverable (e.g., financial statements for landlord consent requests)

### Coordinating the Parties

Real estate counsel typically coordinates with:

- Local counsel
- Clearance attorneys at title companies
- Surveyors
- Appraisers
- Landlords, tenants, and their counsel
- Insurance consultants
- Environmental consultants
- Seller's counsel
- Lender's counsel
- Corporate attorneys on the transaction
- The client

### Third-Party Closing Documents

The process of obtaining third-party deliverables (landlord consents, estoppels) must be initiated well in advance of closing. Because the seller or target company has the relationship with the landlord or tenant, it is usually easier for them to contact the applicable third party. However, real estate counsel should negotiate and approve the form of agreement and follow up aggressively before closing.

### Title-Related Closing Documents

Real estate counsel must ensure the title company is prepared to issue the title insurance policies at closing and meet all criteria outlined in the acquisition agreement. The title company needs to review:

- Indemnity and affidavit to the title company
- Entity documents and resolutions authorizing the transaction
- Deeds
- Assignment and assumption of lease (if leasehold title insurance is being purchased)
- Third-party deliverables (estoppel certificates, consents)
- Transfer tax returns
- Releases or assignments of existing mortgages

### Closing Statement

Real estate counsel should carefully review the closing statement for real estate-related disbursements, including:

- Title insurance premiums and endorsement costs
- Title search fees
- Transfer taxes
- Mortgage recording taxes
- Recording fees
- Survey costs
- Prorations of rent, real property taxes, insurance premiums, water/sewer/utility charges, leasing brokerage commissions

### Post-Closing

Immediately after closing, prepare a list of post-closing matters including receipt of:

- Copies of recorded documents with evidence of recording
- Final title insurance policies (confirm they conform with marked-up title commitment)
- Final surveys

---

## Phase 6: Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees

### Transfer Taxes

Based on the transaction structure, determine applicable transfer taxes resulting from:

- **Fee transfer:** Conveyance of deed or transfer of ownership interests in entity owning real property
- **Leasehold transfer:** Assignment of lease or transfer of ownership interests in tenant entity

Note: Depending on the jurisdiction, transfer taxes may apply to stock purchases or mergers where there is a direct or indirect transfer of a controlling interest in an entity that owns or leases real property.

### Mortgage Recording Taxes

In jurisdictions where mortgage recording tax applies, existing mortgages encumbering the real property can typically be assigned instead of discharged to achieve significant savings. The purchaser, lender, and their counsel should work together to minimize mortgage recording taxes based on the amount of the loan secured by the mortgages in that state.

## Quick Reference: Key Differences by Transaction Type

| Issue | Asset Acquisition | Stock Purchase/Merger |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Title Transfer | Deed required for each parcel | No deed—entity ownership transfers |
| Title Insurance | More likely required; owner's policy common | Non-imputation endorsement recommended if obtained |
| Landlord Consent | Usually required for lease assignment | Only if change of control clause is triggered |
| Transfer Taxes | On deed conveyance | May apply to controlling interest transfers |
| Closing Deliveries | Deeds, assignments of leases | Transfer tax returns, merger certificates as applicable |

---

## Contact and Coordination Checklist

Real estate counsel should have a contact person at the client, target company, or seller from whom they can request additional information about the real estate. The persons in charge of real estate or facilities may not be aware of corporate-level business decisions.

Staying informed during the transaction is one of the biggest challenges. Real estate counsel must be proactive and request updates throughout the transaction because corporate attorneys may not know what real estate issues to identify as they arise or the coordination with third parties required (local counsel, surveyors, title companies).

---

## Documentation Practices

Real estate counsel should keep a memorandum in the client file memorializing:

- Material real estate issues disclosed in the due diligence process
- Advice given to the corporate attorney or client
- Decisions made by the corporate attorney or client to proceed with a matter contrary to real estate counsel's advice

## Detailed Review Guidelines

### Schedule A Review Checklist

| Item | Verify | Standard Requirement |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Effective Date | Note date; calculate gap to closing | Must be updated to "later of closing or recording" |
| Commitment Number | Record for correspondence | N/A |
| Policy Form | 2021 ALTA Loan Policy preferred | Object if older form without justification |
| Insurance Amount | Matches term sheet loan amount | Exact match required |
| Proposed Insured | Lender name exact per term sheet | Must include "affiliates, successors and/or assigns" |
| Legal Description | Compare to survey, commitment letter | Must match exactly across all documents |
| Estate/Interest | Fee simple, leasehold, or specify | Note if less than fee simple |
| Vested Owner | Matches borrower entity name | Must match organizational documents |

### Schedule B-I Requirements Analysis

For each requirement, determine:

1. **Who is responsible?** (Borrower, Title Company, Third Party)
2. **What evidence satisfies it?** (Recording, Payoff Letter, Affidavit, etc.)
3. **Is it relevant to lender's diligence?** (Existing liens, entity authority, tax status)
4. **Timeline risk?** (Can it be satisfied before closing?)

**Requirements of Particular Lender Concern:**
- Payment of existing mortgages/liens (require payoff letters)
- Entity formation/authority documents (verify borrower capacity)
- Payment of real estate taxes (verify no delinquencies)
- Mortgage tax payment (budget in closing costs)
- Construction lien waivers (if recent improvements)
- UCC searches (coordinate with lender's counsel)

### Schedule B-II Exceptions Analysis

**For EACH exception, conduct the following analysis:**

#### Step 1: Categorize the Exception
- **Standard/Pre-printed Exception** → Require deletion per lender standards
- **Specific Recorded Document** → Obtain and review underlying document
- **Survey-Related Matter** → Coordinate with survey review
- **Judgment/Lien** → Require payoff and release

#### Step 2: Determine if Plottable
- Easements (utility, access, drainage) → **Must be shown on survey**
- Restrictions with setbacks → **Must be shown on survey**
- Encroachments → **Must be shown on survey**
- Covenants (use restrictions) → Typically not plottable

#### Step 3: Assess Lender Impact
- Does it affect the physical property?
- Does it create a superior interest?
- Does it restrict use or transfer?
- Does it create ongoing obligations?
- Does it affect access?
- Is there a reverter or forfeiture clause?

#### Step 4: Determine Required Action

| Exception Type | Standard Action |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Standard survey exception | Delete; require ALTA survey |
| Parties in possession | Delete; require affidavit |
| Unrecorded easements | Delete; require affidavit |
| Mechanics lien rights | Delete; require lien waivers if construction |
| Prior year taxes | Delete; require tax certificates |
| Florida submerged lands | Delete; navigational servitude endorsement |
| Utility easements (recorded) | Accept if not affecting improvements |
| Access easements (benefiting property) | Accept; verify on survey |
| CC&Rs | Accept with Form 9 endorsement; review for issues |
| Prior mortgage | Require payoff letter and release |
| Judgment against borrower | Require satisfaction |
| HOA/COA matters | Require estoppel; review for superlien |

### Survey Review Protocol

#### A. Certification Verification
The survey must be certified to:
- [ ] Lender (exact name)
- [ ] Borrower
- [ ] Title Insurance Company

**If any party missing, require re-certification.**

#### B. Legal Description Comparison (CRITICAL)

**This comparison must be character-by-character precise.**

Create a side-by-side comparison:

| Element | Schedule A | Survey | Match? |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Township | | | |
| Range | | | |
| Section | | | |
| Lot/Block | | | |
| Subdivision Name | | | |
| Plat Book/Page | | | |
| Metes & Bounds | | | |
| Total Acreage | | | |

**Common Discrepancies to Flag:**
- Spelling variations (Street vs. St.)
- Punctuation differences
- Section/Township/Range variations
- Lot number formatting (Lot 1 vs. Lot 01)
- Plat book references
- "Together with" appurtenant easements
- Acreage calculations

**If discrepancies exist, specify exactly what must be corrected and in which document.**

#### C. Physical Matters Review

| Matter | Review Item | Acceptable? |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Access** | Direct access to dedicated public street? | Required |
| | If no, access easement recorded and insurable? | Alternative |
| **Boundaries** | Legal description closes mathematically? | Required |
| | Monuments set at major corners? | Required for ALTA |
| **Encroachments** | Improvements within property boundaries? | Required |
| | Neighbor improvements encroaching? | Unacceptable without cure |
| | Property improvements into easements? | Evaluate use |
| **Setbacks** | Improvements comply with recorded restrictions? | Required |
| | Setback violations noted? | Require coverage |
| **Flood Zone** | Zone designation shown? | Required (Table A Item 8) |
| | Improvements in flood zone? | Note for lender |
| **Utilities** | Served by public utilities? | Required |
| | Utility easements for service? | Verify adequacy |

#### D. Exception-to-Survey Cross-Reference

**For each plottable Schedule B exception:**

| Exception # | Document | Plottable? | Shown on Survey? | Action |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------------|--------|
| | | | | |

**If a plottable exception is NOT shown on survey:**
- Instruct surveyor to add
- Verify no conflict with improvements
- If conflict exists, note in objection letter

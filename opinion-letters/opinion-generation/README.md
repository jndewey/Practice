## Key Topics Covered

### Generation Workflow
1. **Analyze the transaction** (parties, structure, security package, governing law)
2. **Select applicable opinion components** (existence, power/authorization, enforceability, no-violation, no-consent, foreign qualification, UCC, real property, Florida-specific)
3. **Adapt assumptions** (signature, enforceability, entity, Florida-specific)
4. **Define Applicable Laws** (governing law, entity statute, specific statutes)
5. **Customize qualifications** (bankruptcy exception, equitable principles, remedies, Florida usury, choice of law, documentary stamp tax)
6. **Prepare schedules** (Transaction Documents, certificates relied upon, foreign qualification, applicable contracts)
7. **Format and output** as .docx with H&K letterhead formatting

### Florida Customary Practice Principles
- No implied opinions; customary professional diligence standard
- Knowledge standard ("primary lawyer group" conscious awareness)
- Entity existence vs. good standing (Florida "certificate of status")
- Enforceability opinion always subject to bankruptcy exception and equitable principles
- Remedies qualification ("golden nugget" approach)
- Florida usury rates (18% for loans up to $500K; 25% for loans over $500K)
- Choice of law (Sailboat Key / Morgan Walton "normal and reasonable relationship" test)
- Documentary stamp tax and intangible tax (failure to pay renders document unenforceable until paid)

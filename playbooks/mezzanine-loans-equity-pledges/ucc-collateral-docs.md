## 1. Amendment to LLC Agreement (Article 8 Opt-In)

### Purpose

By default under the UCC, LLC membership interests are classified as "general intangibles." This amendment redesignates them as "securities" within the meaning of UCC Article 8, which:
- Enables perfection by control (highest priority method)
- Gives the interest holder protected purchaser status
- Allows the lender to obtain UCC insurance coverage
- Defeats competing claims perfected only by filing

### When to Use

- When membership interests are **pledged as collateral** for a mezzanine loan
- When membership interests are **sold to an investor** seeking to insure the purchase under a UCC insurance policy (Eagle 9® policy)

### Key Operative Provision

The amendment adds a new section to the LLC agreement stating:

> "Pursuant to § 8-103(c) of the [State] Uniform Commercial Code, the Membership Interests of Company capital held by Members of the Company shall be considered to be securities governed by Article 8 of the [State] Uniform Commercial Code."

### Drafting Considerations

- **Jurisdiction**: Cross-reference the applicable UCC section for the governing state (the document assumes Delaware, where it is § 8-103(c)).
- **Timing**: The opt-in can occur at formation or by later amendment. If the interests are not designated as securities at the time of pledge, the lender should prohibit any later Article 8 opt-in to prevent a subsequent pledgee from acquiring protected purchaser status over the mezzanine lender.
- **Scope**: Ensure the amendment is the only change being made; if additional amendments are contemplated, address them explicitly.
- **Signatories**: All members should sign. Check the LLC agreement for its amendment provisions.
- **Ratification clause**: Include a ratification provision stating that except as amended, the LLC agreement remains unmodified and in full force and effect.
- **Counterparts**: Include a counterparts clause for execution flexibility (fax/email signatures acceptable, but assemble originals post-closing).

### Protected Purchaser Status

Opting into Article 8 affords the interest holder protected purchaser status, which gives priority over competing claims that are either:
- Designated as general intangibles
- Perfected by filing alone

This is the highest level of UCC priority for this property class.

## 2. Certificate of LLC Interests

### Purpose

A physical certificate representing the membership interests in the mortgage borrower (issuer), delivered to the mezzanine lender to effect perfection by possession/control.

### Key Elements

- **Securities Act legend**: The certificate must state that it has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or state securities laws, and that the holder is acquiring for investment, not distribution.
- **Certificate number**: Unique identifier.
- **Percentage**: Typically 100% of all issued and outstanding membership interests.
- **Issuer identification**: Full legal name and state of organization of the mortgage borrower.
- **Registered owner**: The mezzanine borrower (pledgor).
- **Article 8 designation**: The certificate must state that each LLC interest shall continue as a "security" within the meaning of Article 8 of the UCC.
- **Transfer restriction legend**: Reference to the LLC agreement's transfer restrictions.
- **Transfer agent**: The mortgage borrower maintains books for registering transfers.

### Indorsement (Reverse Side)

The reverse side includes a blank indorsement form (like a stock power):
- "FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned does hereby sell, assign and transfer unto [BLANK] ___% limited liability company interest..."
- Signed by the pledgor with a signature guarantee
- The blank indorsement allows transfer without further action from the pledgor

### CMBS / Rating Agency Expectations

For securitized loans, rating agencies typically expect:
- 100% pledge (no minority interests unpledged)
- Article 8 opt-in for protected purchaser status
- Certificated securities (physical certificates)
- Perfection by both filing and control

### Critical Handling Note

**Do not lose the certificate.** If the original certificate is lost, destroyed, or stolen, the mezzanine lender may lose perfection by possession. The replacement process requires:
- An affidavit of loss
- A surety bond (potentially expensive)
- Issuance of a replacement certificate
- The replacement certificate must carry a legend noting it is a replacement

## 3. Control Agreement

### Purpose

Used when the pledged membership interests are **uncertificated** securities. The mortgage borrower (as issuer of the interests) agrees to follow the written instructions of the mezzanine lender without further consent of the pledgor. This establishes perfection by control under UCC §8-106(c).

### Key Provisions

The mortgage borrower agrees:
- To comply with instructions from the mezzanine lender regarding the pledged interests without further consent of the mezzanine borrower
- Not to comply with instructions from any other person regarding the interests
- To register any transfer directed by the mezzanine lender
- Not to register any transfer unless directed by the mezzanine lender
- To maintain the Article 8 designation

### When Triggered

The control agreement is typically "springing" — the mortgage borrower follows the pledgor's instructions in the ordinary course, but upon default under the mezzanine loan (and notice from the lender), the mortgage borrower must follow the lender's instructions exclusively.

### Relationship to Confirmation Statement

The control agreement for uncertificated interests serves the same function as the confirmation statement for certificated interests — it establishes the mortgage borrower's acknowledgment of and consent to the pledge, and its agreement to follow lender instructions.

## 4. Irrevocable Proxy Agreement

### Purpose

Grants the mezzanine lender an irrevocable proxy to vote the pledged membership interests on specific matters. Delivered alongside (and cross-referenced to) the pledge and security agreement.

### Scope of Voting Rights

The proxy is typically **limited** to specific enumerated matters:
- Any change to the Article 8 designation (Article 8 Matters) — this is **always** included
- Voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy filings
- Dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the mortgage borrower
- Merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all assets
- Issuance of additional membership interests
- Material amendments to the LLC agreement

### Key Drafting Points

- **Irrevocable**: The proxy is coupled with an interest (the security interest in the pledged collateral) and is therefore irrevocable under applicable law.
- **Duration**: Continues until the secured obligations are fully satisfied and the pledge is released.
- **Exclusive vs. concurrent**: For Article 8 Matters, the lender's proxy is typically exclusive at all times. For other matters, it may be concurrent pre-default and exclusive post-default.
- **No lender liability**: Include a provision stating that the lender has no obligation to exercise the proxy and is not liable for failing to do so.
- **Successor binding**: The proxy binds the pledgor's successors and assigns.

### Lender Liability Caution

Although the proxy grants broad voting rights, the lender must exercise caution:
- Pre-default: Exercise only Article 8 Matters proxy; avoid participating in day-to-day affairs
- Post-default: May exercise broadly, but excessive operational control can create lender liability exposure, particularly CERCLA environmental liability

## 5. Acknowledgment, Consent, and Direction Letter

### Purpose

A letter from the pledgor (mezzanine borrower) to the mortgage borrower in which:

1. **Acknowledgment**: The mortgage borrower acknowledges that it has received notice of the pledge
2. **Consent**: The mortgage borrower consents to the pledge and confirms it does not violate the LLC agreement
3. **Registration**: The mortgage borrower confirms it has registered the pledge on its books and records
4. **No adverse claims**: The mortgage borrower confirms it knows of no liens or adverse claims on the pledged interests
5. **Direction**: The pledgor directs the mortgage borrower to register the pledge

### Relationship to Other Documents

This letter is separate from but related to:
- The pledge agreement (which creates the security interest)
- The control agreement or confirmation statement (which establishes the lender's control)
- The certificate of membership (which evidences the interests)

---

## 6. UCC-1 Financing Statement

### Purpose

Filed with the appropriate state authority (typically the Secretary of State in the pledgor's state of organization) to provide public notice of the security interest and perfect the lien by filing.

### Filing Jurisdiction

File in the state where the pledgor (mezzanine borrower) is organized — typically Delaware.

### Collateral Description

Should match or cross-reference the collateral description in the pledge agreement. Can be either:
- A specific description matching the pledge agreement
- A broader "all assets" description (though mezzanine lenders typically use a specific description)

### Continuation and Assignment

- **Continuation**: UCC-1 must be continued every 5 years by filing a UCC-3 continuation statement before the lapse date
- **Assignment**: On secondary market sale, a UCC-3 assignment statement transfers the filing from the originating lender to the purchasing investor
- **Amendment**: Any changes to the pledgor's name or organizational jurisdiction require a UCC-3 amendment

### Relationship to Control

Filing provides backup perfection but lower priority than control. Best practice is always to perfect by both filing AND control.

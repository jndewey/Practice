# Zoning Due Diligence Review for Commercial Mortgage Lenders

A skill for reviewing, analyzing, and advising on zoning due diligence in connection with commercial real estate mortgage loan transactions. This skill guides Claude through the key areas of zoning compliance that lender's counsel must evaluate before loan closing, and provides frameworks for identifying issues, recommending remediation, and drafting appropriate loan document protections.

## Why Zoning Due Diligence Matters

Zoning violations can cause a property to lose its certificate of occupancy, rendering it unlawful to occupy. This directly threatens the lender's collateral value and the borrower's ability to generate income to service the debt. Property owners who violate zoning laws may face fines or, in extreme cases, criminal penalties. Because zoning is one of the most powerful means by which local governments control land use, lender's counsel must confirm that the mortgaged property complies with all applicable zoning laws and regulations before the loan closes.

## Core Review Framework

When reviewing zoning due diligence, work through each of the following areas systematically. Flag any item that is missing, incomplete, or raises a concern.

### 1. Zoning Classification and Permitted Use

Confirm the property's zoning classification and verify that the borrower's current and intended use of the property is a permitted use under the applicable zoning ordinance. Key questions to evaluate:

- What is the property's zoning district designation?
- Is the current use (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, mixed-use) a permitted use as-of-right, or does it require a special permit, variance, or conditional use approval?
- Are there any prohibited uses that could affect the borrower's business plan or future tenanting?
- If the property is a mixed-use development, does each component use conform to the applicable zoning classification?
- Are there any pending zoning amendments or rezoning applications that could affect the property?

### 2. Dimensional and Bulk Requirements

Verify the property's compliance with all dimensional and bulk regulations. These typically include:

- **Minimum lot size**: Does the lot meet the minimum area requirement for its zoning district?
- **Building height and stories**: Does the building comply with maximum height restrictions (both number of stories and total height in feet)?
- **Floor area ratio (FAR) / total square footage**: Does the building's total square footage comply with the maximum permitted FAR or aggregate square footage?
- **Lot coverage**: Does the building footprint (and, if applicable, all improvements collectively) comply with the maximum lot coverage percentage?
- **Building setbacks**: Does the building maintain the required minimum distances from front, rear, and side property boundary lines? Note that setback requirements can vary depending on which boundary is measured.
- **Proximity to other structures**: Does the building comply with any minimum separation requirements from other structures on the property?

### 3. Parking Requirements

Confirm that the property provides the minimum number of parking spaces required by the zoning ordinance. Minimum parking requirements are typically calculated based on:

- For commercial and industrial properties: the aggregate square footage of the improvements the parking lot serves.
- For multi-family residential properties: the number of units constructed at the property.
- For mixed-use properties: a combination of the above, often with shared-parking reductions available.

Flag any parking deficiency and determine whether a variance, shared-parking agreement, or payment-in-lieu arrangement has been obtained or is available.

### 4. Certificates of Occupancy

Lenders require evidence that the property's improvements have a valid, permanent certificate of occupancy (CO). Review the following:

- Has a permanent CO been issued for all buildings and improvements on the property?
- Does the CO reflect the property's current use and occupancy?
- Is the CO current, or has it been superseded, revoked, or conditioned?
- If the property has undergone renovations, additions, or changes of use since the original CO was issued, have amended or supplemental COs been obtained?
- If no CO exists, does the property have vested or grandfathered rights that eliminate the requirement? (See Section 5 below.)

Certificates of occupancy are issued and maintained by the local municipality's building department or equivalent local agency. The zoning report should include copies of all applicable COs.

### 5. Vested Rights and Grandfathering

Some properties have entitlements that are vested in the property (not the owner) that predate current zoning requirements. These "grandfathered" rights require careful analysis because they are not perpetual. Evaluate the following:

- Does the property rely on any vested or grandfathered rights for its current use, density, height, setbacks, parking, or other dimensional requirements?
- What is the legal basis for the vested right (e.g., pre-existing nonconforming use, building constructed before adoption of local building codes)?
- Under what circumstances can the vested right be lost? Common triggers include:
  - Change in use
  - Casualty or destruction beyond a specified threshold (e.g., destruction of more than 50% of the building's value)
  - Reconstruction, redevelopment, or substantial renovation
  - Abandonment or discontinuation of the nonconforming use for a specified period
  - Expansion of the nonconforming use
- Are the vested rights subject to any conditions or limitations?
- What actions should be prohibited (or required) to preserve the vested right?

**Critical loan document implications**: If any vested right is crucial to the property's CO or lawful use, the loan documents must include:

- Covenants ensuring continued compliance with the conditions of the vested right.
- Representations and warranties confirming no acts have occurred (or will occur) that could extinguish the vested right.
- Negative covenants prohibiting the borrower from taking any action that could trigger a loss of vested rights without the lender's prior written consent.

### 6. Variances, Special Permits, and Conditional Approvals

If the property's compliance depends on any variance, special permit, special exception, or conditional use approval, review:

- The specific terms and conditions of the approval.
- Whether the approval runs with the land or is personal to the current owner/operator.
- Expiration dates or sunset provisions.
- Ongoing compliance requirements and reporting obligations.
- Whether any conditions have been violated or are at risk of violation.

### 7. Zoning Report Review

Zoning reports are prepared by third-party providers and are now a standard requirement in most commercial real estate loans. The zoning report should include:

- Confirmation of the property's zoning classification.
- Copies of applicable local zoning ordinances.
- Copies of applicable permits, variances, and certificates of occupancy.
- Identification of any zoning nonconformities or violations.

**Important limitations**: Zoning reports are a fast and affordable tool, but they do not come with warranties beyond the price of the report. Lender's counsel should independently verify any material findings, particularly for complex properties or those relying on vested rights or variances.

**Survey integration**: Lenders typically require the survey to include zoning information. However, surveyors are not required to incorporate zoning information into the survey unless they are provided with a zoning report or other zoning evidence. Ensure the zoning report is delivered to the surveyor in time for the survey to reflect the zoning data.

### 8. Flood Zone Designation

Lenders must determine the flood zone designation of the mortgaged property, because federally regulated lending institutions cannot make, extend, renew, or increase a loan on improved real estate located within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) in a community participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) unless the borrower maintains flood insurance for the entire loan term.

Review the following:

- Has a flood zone certification been ordered and received?
- What is the property's FEMA flood zone designation?
- Is the property located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)?
- If in an SFHA, does the borrower have (or can it obtain) compliant flood insurance?
- Is the flood zone designation reflected on the survey?
- Has a flood zone elevation certificate been prepared by the surveyor?

**Mandatory flood insurance statutes**: The following federal laws govern mandatory flood insurance procurement:

- National Flood Insurance Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 4011 et seq.)
- Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. § 4003)
- National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. § 5254(a))
- Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (42 U.S.C. § 4004)

Flood insurance may be obtained through private insurers or through the NFIP.

### 9. Federal Laws Intersecting with Zoning

In addition to local zoning, confirm that the property complies with federal laws that intersect with property ownership, development, and operations:

- **Fair Housing Act** (42 U.S.C. § 3601): Prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, or negotiation of housing based on protected class status. Administered by HUD.
- **Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)** (42 U.S.C. §§ 12101–12213): Requires property owners to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified persons absent undue hardship.
- **National Historical Preservation Act** (54 U.S.C. §§ 300101–307108): May limit redevelopment or reconstruction of designated historic properties.
- **Climate change and building code regulations**: Increasingly, federal and state regulations enacted to address climate change may impact local building codes and affect the property's compliance.

## Issue Identification and Risk Assessment

When a zoning issue is identified, assess it using the following framework:

### Severity Levels

- **Critical / Deal Stopper**: The property cannot be lawfully occupied as intended; the issue cannot be cured before closing or within a reasonable post-closing period. Examples: no CO and no vested rights; use is prohibited in the zoning district; property is in an SFHA with no available flood insurance.
- **Material / Requires Remediation**: The issue can be cured, but requires action before or after closing with appropriate loan document protections. Examples: expired variance requiring renewal; minor dimensional nonconformity requiring a variance application; deferred CO amendment after tenant improvement work.
- **Minor / Monitor**: The issue is unlikely to affect the property's value or the borrower's ability to service the debt, but should be documented in the loan file and monitored. Examples: pending zoning text amendment that would not affect the property's current use; minor parking deficiency covered by a shared-parking agreement.

### Recommended Actions by Severity

**Critical issues**: Advise the lender that the transaction should not close unless and until the issue is resolved. Consider whether the issue can be addressed through a pre-closing condition or whether the loan structure must be modified.

**Material issues**: Draft appropriate loan document provisions to protect the lender, which may include:

- Closing conditions requiring delivery of specified zoning approvals or evidence of compliance.
- Post-closing obligations with deadlines and consequences for non-compliance.
- Additional representations, warranties, and covenants.
- Reserves or escrows to fund remediation.
- Events of default tied to loss of zoning compliance.

**Minor issues**: Document the issue in the due diligence summary and ensure it is reflected in the borrower's representations and warranties. Consider adding a monitoring covenant if the issue could escalate.

## Interaction Guidance

When the user provides a zoning report, loan agreement, or other transaction documents for review:

1. **Start with the zoning report** (or equivalent zoning evidence) to understand the property's zoning classification, permitted uses, and current compliance status.
2. **Cross-reference the CO** against the current use and any recent renovations or tenant improvements.
3. **Identify any nonconformities** and determine whether they are covered by vested rights, variances, or other approvals.
4. **Check the flood zone designation** and confirm whether flood insurance is required.
5. **Review the loan documents** to ensure all zoning-related representations, warranties, covenants, and closing conditions are adequate given the property's specific zoning profile.
6. **Produce a clear, prioritized summary** of findings and recommendations, organized by severity.

When the user asks general questions about zoning due diligence without providing specific documents, provide guidance based on the frameworks in this skill, tailored to the specific property type, jurisdiction, or issue described.

## Key Topics Covered

### Review Workflow
1. **Identify transaction parameters** (type, parties, governing law, collateral, opinion giver)
2. **Structural completeness check** (preamble, definitions, documents reviewed, assumptions, opinions, qualifications, reliance, signature)
3. **Cross-check against conditions precedent** (compare CP requirements to delivered opinions)
4. **Review each opinion section** (classify issues as Critical, Negotiate, Acceptable, or Note)
5. **Analyze assumptions** (customary? reasonable? relevant? does it gut an opinion?)
6. **Analyze qualifications** (customary? does it nullify an opinion? are sub-qualifications tailored? is the remedies qualification adequate?)
7. **Evaluate reliance and disclosure provisions** (agent and lender coverage, assignees, Wachovia limitation)
8. **Identify missing opinions** (expected opinions by transaction type matrix)
9. **Generate review memorandum** (executive summary, findings table, missing opinions, recommended comments, closing recommendation)

### Key Principles for Lender's Counsel
- Golden Rule: do not request opinions you would not give if roles were reversed
- Customary practice controls; opinion is not an insurance policy
- Lender's counsel has malpractice exposure for negligently accepting deficient opinions
- Agree on opinion language early in the transaction, not at closing
- No implied opinions; opinion speaks only as of its date
